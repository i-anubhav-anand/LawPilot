Can a landlord force a \ntenant to move? How many days' notice does a tenant have to give a landlord before \nmoving out? Can a landlord raise a tenant\u2019s rent? California Tenants \u2013 A Guide to \nResidential Tenants\u2019 and Landlords\u2019 Rights and Responsibilities answers these \nquestions and many others.  \nWhether the tenant is renting a room, apartment, house, or duplex, the landlord- \ntenant relationship is governed by federal, state, and local laws. This booklet focuses on \nthe most significant aspects of the relationship of landlords and tenants in Califor nia, \nparticularly the California laws that govern the landlord- tenant relationship. There are \nother parts of the landlord- tenant law that may not be covered. It is suggested that in \naddition to reading and using this guide, tenants and landlords may wish to seek additional information regarding their rights and responsibilities from a tenant -landlord \nprogram, a housing clinic, a legal aid organization, or an attorney.  \nIt is important that tenants understand their legal rights when it comes to renting a \nresidential unit. This booklet discusses various fair housing laws that protect tenants \nfrom unlawful discrimination and harassment. These laws are designed to protect and \nuphold the inalienable rights of all California tenants, without compromise.  \nThis booklet also suggests steps that both landlords and tenants can take to develop \nand maintain a good working relationship. Although this booklet is written from the \ntenant\u2019s point of view, landlords can also benefit from the information contained herein.  \nTenants and landlords should discuss their expectations and responsibilities before \nthey enter into a rental agreement. If a problem occurs, the tenant and landlord should try to resolve the problem through open communication and discussion. Honest \ndiscussion of problems may show each party that they are not completely in the right, \nand that a fair compromise is warranted.  \nIf the problem is one for which the landlord is responsible (see pages 47- 51), the \nlandlord may be willing to correct the problem or work out a solution without further action by the tenant. If the problem is one for which the tenant is responsible (see page \n49), the tenant may agree to correct the problem once the tenant understands the \nlandlord\u2019s concerns. If the parties cannot reach a solution on their own, they may be able to resolve the problem through mediation or arbitration (see page 106 ). In some \nsituations, legal action may be the only  solution.  \nWhile much of this booklet focuses on tenants, it is designed to educate landlords and \ntenants on the fundamental aspects of rental housing laws in California. Although this booklet itself is not considered legal authority, the footnotes contained within i t refer to \nthe statutes and case law that are considered binding legal authority.  \nThe Department of Real Estate hopes that tenants and landlords will use the \ninformation contained in this booklet to avoid problems in the first place and resolve \nproblems fairly when they do occur.  \n \n2   \n \nNEW CALIFORNIA LAW FOR 2024  \n \n \nStarting in 2024, there will be several major amendments to Landlord and Tenant \nrights in California as the result of legislation passed by the Legislature and signed \nby Governor Newsom in 2023. Notable new changes taking effect in 2024 include:  \nSecurity Deposits.  Beginning July 1, 2024, security deposits will be limited to an \namount equal to one month\u2019s rent for most rentals and two month's rent for rentals \nby small landlords. AB 12 (Haney, Chapter 733, Statutes of 2023). \nParking.  Tenants will be allowed to refuse to pay for parking in newer qualifying \nresidential properties. This will allow residents to avoid the cost of parking when it is bundled with the price of rent. AB 1317 (Carillo, Chapter 757, Statutes of 2023).  \nCriminal  Background.  Landlords will be prohibited from enforcing local rules \nand regulations that penalize or evict tenants for contact with law enforcement like being investigated or accused of crimes or receiving calls from law enforcement for suspected criminal conduct. AB 1418 (McKinnor, Chapter 476, Statutes of 2023).  \nRent  Control.  Communities with rent control can require landlords to offer \ndisabled tenants with the opportunity to swap for more accessible units when they become available. AB 1620 (Zbur, Chapter 767, Statutes of 2023). \nCredit  History.  Landlords receiving government rent subsidies must allow \napplicants the opportunity to establish credit using lawful, verifiable alternative evidence instead of a credit report. Such evidence would include records of \ngovernment assistance, pay stubs or bank statements. SB 267 (Eggman,  Chapter \n267, Statutes of 2023).  \nTermination of Tenancy.  Landlords pursuing no -fault case evictions for \npurposes of occupying the property for themselves or relatives face heightened standards of intent and occupancy of evicted properties. SB 567 (Durazo, Chapter 290, Statutes of 2023).  \nE-bikes and personal electric transportation.  Tenants are allowed to store and \nrecharge electric bikes and motors in their residences subject to certain conditions and exceptions. Landlords are prohibited from preventing tenants to store and charge such devices in their residence. SB 712 (Portantino,  Chapter 630, Statutes \nof 2023.)\n3   \n \nHOW TO USE THIS BOOKLET  \n \n \nYou can find the information you need by using the Table of Contents, Index, and \nGlossary of Terms contained in this booklet.  \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \nAs the Table of Contents shows, this booklet is divided into nine main sections. Each \nmain section is divided into smaller sub -sections. For example, if you seek information \nabout the rental agreement, look under \u201cRental Agreements and Leases\u201d in the \n\u201cBEFORE YOU AGREE TO RENT\u201d section.  \nGLOSSARY  \nIf you just want to know the meaning of a term (such as \" eviction \" or \"holding \ndeposit \") look in the Glossary (see pages 108 -115). The glossary gives the meaning of \nmore than 60 terms. Each term is printed in boldface type the first time that it appears in the booklet.  \nThe Department of Real Estate hopes that you will locate the information you are \nlooking for in this booklet. If you cannot find what you are looking for, call or write to one of the resources listed in \u201cGetting Help from a Third Party\u201d (see pages 1 05-106).  \n \n \nWHO IS A LANDLORD AND WHO IS A TENANT?  \n \n \nGENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT LANDLORDS AND TENANTS  \nA landlord is a person or entity that owns a rental unit. The landlord rents the rental \nunit to another person, called a tenant , for the tenant to live in. The tenant obtains the \nright to the exclusive use and possession of the rental unit during the rental period. \nSometimes, the landlord is called the owner, and the tenant is called a resident.  \nA rental unit is an apartment, house, duplex, condominium, accessory dwelling unit \n(ADU), room, or other structure or part thereof that a landlord rents to a tenant to live in. Because a tenant uses the rental unit to live in, it is called a residential rental unit or dwelling unit.  \nOften, a landlord will retain a rental agent or property manager to manage their \nrental property. The agent or property manager is compensated by the landlord to represent the landlord's interests. In some instances, the tenant will deal with the rental agent or property manager on behalf of the landlord. In other instances, the tenant will \ndeal directly with the landlord. For example, a tenant can work directly with the agent \nor property manager to resolve problems with the rental unit. When a tenant needs  to \ngive the landlord one of the required notices described in this booklet (for example, see pages 63- 67 and 89 -91), the tenant can give that notice directly to the landlord\u2019s rental \nagent, property manager, or another person if that person is identified in the rental agreement to receive  service. \n \n4  The name, address and telephone number of the person authorized to receive legal \nnotices on behalf of the owner (such as a property manager or owner if no property \nmanager is used) must be written in the rental agreement or posted conspicuously in \nthe rent al unit or building.1 \nSPECIAL SITUATIONS  \nThe tenant's rights and responsibilities discussed in this booklet apply only to people \nwhom the law defines as tenants. Generally, under California law, lodgers and residents \nof hotels and motels living in these locations for more than 30 days have the same rights \nas tenants.2\u202fThe rights and responsibilities of lodgers and residents of ho tels and motels \nare discussed in the \u201cSpecial Situati ons\u201d section found on pages 4-5.3 \n \n  \n \n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n    \n \n  \n \n5   \nSpecial Situations \n \nHotels and motels  \nIf you are a resident in a hotel or motel, you do not have the rights of a tenant if you \nare in any of the following situations: \n1. You live in a hotel, motel, residence club, or other short -term lodging facility for 30 days \nor less, and your occupancy is subject to the state\u2019s hotel occupancy  tax. \n2. You live in a hotel, motel, residence club, or other lodging facility for more than 30 \ndays , but have not paid for all room and related charges owed by the 30th  day. \n3. You live in a hotel or motel to which the manager has a right of access and control, and all of the following is  true: \n\u2022 The hotel or motel allows occupancy for periods of fewer than seven  days.  \n\u2022 All of the following services are provided for all residents:  \n\uf0d8 a fireproof safe for residents\u2019  use; \n\uf0d8 a central telephone service; \n\uf0d8 maid, mail, and room service;  and \n\uf0d8 food service provided by a food establishment that is on or next to the hotel or motel \ngrounds and that is operated in conjunction with the hotel or  motel.  \nIf you live in a unit described by either 1, 2, or 3 above, you are not considered a \ntenant. Rather , you are considered a guest . Therefore, you do not have the same rights \nas a tenant.4 For example, a hotel manager can lock out a guest who does not pay his or \nher room charges on time, while a landlord cannot resort to self -help eviction measures \nby locking the tenant out and must follow formal eviction proceedings to evict a \nnonpaying tenant.  \nResidential hotels  \nIf a residential hotel serves as your primary residence, you possess some of the same \nlegal rights as a tenant.5 A residential hotel is any building containing six or more \nguestrooms designed, used, rented or occupied for sleeping purposes by guests, and \nwhich serves as the primary residence of those guests.6 A locking mail receptacle must be \nprovided for each guest of a residential hotel.7 \nIt is unlawful for the manager of a residential hotel to require a guest to move or to \ncheck out and re -register before the guest has lived there for 30 days, if their purpose is \nto have the guest maintain transient occupancy status (and, therefore, not gain the legal \nrights of a tenant).8 A person who violates this law may be subject to a $500 civil penalty \nand may be required to pay the guest\u2019s attorney fees. \n \n \n \n \n \n6   \nSingle lodger in a private residence  \nA lodger is a person who lives in a room in a house where the owner lives. The owner \nmay enter all areas occupied by the lodger  and has overall control of the house.9 Most \nlodgers have the same rights as tenants.10 \nHowever, in the case of a single lodger in a house where there are no other lodgers, \nthe owner can evict the lodger without using formal eviction proceedings. Instead, the \nowner can give the lodger written notice that the lodger cannot continue to use the room. \nThe amount of notice must be the same as required for any other periodic tenancy (see \nLandlord\u2019s notice to end a periodic tenancy , page 62). After the owner has given the \nlodger proper notice and the applicable time period has expired, the lodger has  no further \nright to remain in the owner\u2019s house and may be removed as a trespasser if t hey refuse \nto leave.11 However, the lodger may dispute their status as a lodger which may \nnecessitate an unlawful detainer action to be filed by the owner to obtain a writ of possession to remove the lodger.  \nTransitional housing  \nSome residents may actually occupy \u201ctransitional housing.\u201d Transitional housing \nprovides lodging and services to formerly homeless persons for periods of 30 days to 24 \nmonths. Residents of transitional housing, who do not pay rent to occupy that housing, \nare generally referred to as \u201cparticipants\u201d and are subject to specific behavior rules and \neviction procedures.\n12 If rent is paid, then they will be considered tenants.  \nMobilehome parks and recreational vehicle parks \nMost landlord- tenant relationships in mobilehome parks and recreational vehicle \nparks are governed  by the Mobilehome Residency Law13 and the Recreational Vehicle \nPark Occupancy Law.14 \n \nHowever, normal landlord- tenant law, including eviction procedures ( see pages 90-\n104), must be followed for certain mobilehome residents. Specifically, a person who leases a mobilehome from its owner (where the owner has leased the site for the mobilehome directly from the management of the mobilehome park) is subject to landlord- tenant law procedures described in this booklet and not any of the in the \nMobilehome Residency Law. The same is true for a person who leases occupancy in a mobilehome from the park  management.  \nYou can find more information on the Mobilehome Residency Law by accessing the \nfollowing link: https://www.hcd.ca.gov/manufactured- mobile -home/mobile- home-  \nombudsman/mobilehome- resident -rights.shtml . \n \n \n   \n7   \n \nLOOKING FOR A RENTAL UNIT  \n \n \nLOOKING FOR AND INSPECTING RENTAL UNITS  \nLooking for a rental unit  \nWhen you are looking for a rental unit, the most important things to think about are:  \n\u2022 The dollar limit that you can afford for monthly rent and  utilities.  \n\u2022 The dollar limit that you can afford for all required fees and depos its (for example, \napplication screening fees, holding, security, and pet  deposits).  \n\u2022 If the property is located in a city or other area that limits the amount the rent can be \nincreased each year (usually referred to as \u201c rent control \u201d). \n\u2022 The location that you want. \nIn addition, you also should carefully consider the following:  \n\u2022 The type of rental unit that you want (for example, an apar tment complex, a duplex, \naccessory dwelling unit (ADU), or a single- family  house).  \n\u2022 The specificat ions or amenities that you want (such as, the number of bedrooms and \nbathrooms).  \n\u2022 Whether you want a month- to-month  rental agreement or a rental agreement for a \nfixed -rental term ( see pages  80-82). \n\u2022 Access to schools, proximity to employment, stores, public transportation, medi cal \nfacilities, libraries, child -care facilities, and other necessities and  conveniences.  \n\u2022 The neighborhood (for example, its safety or available green spaces).  \n\u2022 The condition of the rental unit (see \u201cInspecting before you rent,\u201d page 8 ). \n\u2022 Whether the unit is physically accessible or can be reasonabl y modified to allow a \nperson with a disability to access and enjoy the  housing.  \n\u2022 Other special require ments that you or your family members may have (for  example, \nwheelchair access).  \n\u2022 What  State and local tenant protection laws may apply to the unit (see pages 90-\n91). \nYou can obtain information on places to rent from many sources. Many websites list \nrental properties. Local newspapers carry classified advertisements on available rental \nunits. In many areas, free weekly or monthly publications devoted to rental listings are available. Local real estate offices and property management companies often advertise rental listings. Bulletin boards in public buildings, local colleges, and places of worship often have notices about places for rent. You can also look for \u201cFor Rent\u201d signs in the neighborhoods where you would like to li ve. \nNote that landlords and housing providers cannot advertise or state a preference for \ntenants  with certain sources of income. For example, an advertisement stating,  \u201cNo \nSection 8 tenants,\u201d is unlawful.  \n \n8  Inspecting before you rent  \nBefore you decide to rent, carefully inspect the rental unit with the landlord or the \nlandlord\u2019s agent. This will help you to see if the unit is a safe and healthy place for you to \nlive and will give you a chance to request needed repairs before you move in. It will also protect you from being held responsible for conditions that already existed when you move in. Make sure that the unit has been well maintained. Use the inventory checklist \n(pages 123 -126) as an inspection guide and  take notes about any needed repairs. Ask \nthat you and the landlord (or agent) both sign the inventory checklist at the end to show \nyou both agree with what it says. You can also take pictures of any issues on your \nphone. When you inspect the rental unit, look for the following problems:  \n\u2022 Cracks or holes in the floor, walls, or  ceiling.  \n\u2022 Signs of leaking water or water damage in the floor, walls, or c eiling; this may include \ndry or wet spots, flaking, bubbling, or a damp or moldy  smell. \n\u2022 The presence of mold that might affect you o r your family\u2019s health and safety. Mold \nmay appear as dark spots on a wall or  floor. \n\u2022 Signs of rust in water ap pearing near the faucet. Bad smelling or discolored water \ncoming from the faucet.  \n\u2022 Leaks in bathroom or kitchen fixtures.  \n\u2022 Lack of hot  water. \n\u2022 Windows and doors that do not open all the way or fail to shut  securely.  \n\u2022 Inadequate lighting or insufficient electrical  outlets.  \n\u2022 Inadequate heating or air  conditioning.  \n\u2022 Inadequate ventilation or offensive odors. \n\u2022 Defects in electrical wiring and fixtures.  \n\u2022 Damaged flooring.  \n\u2022 Damaged furnishings (if it is a furnished unit). \n\u2022 Signs of insects, vermin, or  rodents.  \n\u2022 Accumulated dirt and  debris.  \n\u2022 Inadequate trash and garbage receptacles.  \n\u2022 Chipping paint in buildings, especially older buildings. Paint chipping could be \nindicative that the rental unit may be poorly maintained. Paint chips in older  buildings  \nsometimes contain lead, which can cause lead poisoning in children if eaten. If the rental unit was built before 1978, you should read the booklet, \u201cProtect Your Family From Lead in Your Home,\u201d which is available by calling (800) -424-LEAD or online at \nhttps://www.epa.gov/lead/protect- your-family -lead-your-home -english . \n\u2022 Signs  of asbestos -containing materials in older buildings, such as flaking ceiling til es, \nor crumbling pipe wrap or insulation. (Asbestos particles can cause serious  health \nproblems if inhaled or consumed.) For more information, go to \nwww.epa.gov/asbestos . \n\u2022 Any sign of hazardous substances, toxic che micals, or other hazardous  waste \nproducts in the rental unit or on the  property.  \n9  Also, look at the exterior of the building and any common areas, such as hallways and \ncourtyards. Does the building appear to be well -maintained? Are the common areas \nclean and orderly?  \nThe quality of rental units can vary greatly. You should understand the positive and \nnegative aspects of the unit and consider all of them before deciding whether to rent, \nand if the monthly rent is reasonable. Rental units without the amenities listed in this \nsection (generally) are unlawful and violate the Health and Safety Code. They should not be rented, unless repaired by the owner  first. \nAsk the landlord who will be responsible for paying for utilities (gas, electric, water, \nand trash collection). You will probably be responsible for paying for  some, and possibly \nall, of these utilities. Try to find out how much money the previous tenant paid for utilities.  \nThis will help you calculate whether you can afford the total amount of the rent and utilities each month. With increasing energy costs, it is also important to consider whether the rental unit and its appliances are energy efficient.  \nIf the rental unit is a house or duplex with a yard, ask the landlord who will be \nresponsible for taking care of the yard. If you will be responsible for the yardwork, ask \nwhether the landlord will supply necessary equipment, such as a lawn mower and a hose. However, regardless of what the lease states, a landlord is always responsible for \nmaking sure the outdoor area is clean and free of debris and garbage.\n15 At the same \ntime, the tenant has a duty to keep the premises that they occupy and use clean and sanitary.\n16 \nDuring your initial viewing of the rental unit, you will have the chance to see how your \npotential landlord reacts to any concerns and/or questions that you raise. At the same \ntime, the landlord will learn how you likely will handle potential problems. Whi le you may \nnot reach agreement on every issue, how you get along during the initial viewing \nprocess will help both of you decide whether you will become a tenant.  \nIf you find problems like those listed above, discuss them with the landlord. If the \nproblems are ones that the landlord is required by law to repair (see pages 47- 51), find \nout when the landlord intends to make the repairs. If you decide to rent the unit, it is recommended to include any repair promises made by the landlord as part of the written \nrental agreement, including the date by which the landlord will complete the necessary repairs.  \nIf you think you may rent the unit, make note of any problems you observe when \nlooking at the unit, including taking pictures and video. Be sure to address these issues  \nwhen you perform a \u201cwalk -through\u201d with the landlord before or just after moving so they \nare included on the inventory checklist (see Inventory Checklist page 123 ). If the \nLandlord promises to make some of the repairs before you move in, be sure to confirm \nthis in writing to avoid any problems later. You can write the promises down and ask the landlord to sign or send an email or text about the issue(s), requesting a reply as \nacknowledgement.\u201d However, it is recommended that you make any repair promises a part of  the written rental agreement to avoid any problems later.  \nGenerally, the landlord will have a detailed move- in walkthrough form that the landlord \nwill provide to all parties prior to the tenant moving in their possessions.  \n10  Finally, you should walk or drive around the neighborhood during the day, and again \nin the evening, to get a feel for the neighborhood. Ask neighbors whether they like living \nin the area. If the rental unit is in an apartment complex, ask some of the tenants how they get along with the landlord and the other tenants. Ask other tenants if the landlord has evicted tenants in the past or has served many eviction notices on other tenants.  \nYou may also want to ask how quickly the landlord responds to requests for repairs. If you are concerned about safety, ask neighbors and tenants if they know of any problems and whether they think the area is safe.  \nTHE RENTAL APPLICATION  \nBefore renting to you, most landlords will ask you to fill out a written rental \napplication . A rental application is different from a rental agreement ( see pages 21- 23). \nThe rental application is like a job or credit application that the landlord will use to decide whether to rent to you.  \nA rental application usually asks for the following information:  \n\u2022 The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of your current and past  employers.  \nNOTE : Because California\u2019s fair housing law prohibits discrimination on the basis of \nsource of income, tenants who will pay some or all of the rent from other than \nemployment income must be given the opportunity to provide verification of \ntheir income from those non- employment sources.  \n\u2022 The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of your current and past  landlords.  \n\u2022 The names,  addresses, and telephone numbers of people whom you want to use as \nreferences.  \n\u2022 Criminal history information ( see page  11). \n\u2022 Tax identification number, which may be Social Security  number.  \n\u2022 Your driver\u2019s license number.  \nThere may be instances where an applicant cannot provide a social security or driver \nlicense number. In such cases, an applicant may provide a \u201cgovernment -issued\u201d photo \nidentification such as a passport or a foreign driver license instead which would allow  the \nlandlord to verify the applicant\u2019s identity without inquiring about the applicant\u2019s \nimmigration status, which is prohibited under the law (see page 13) . \nAs of  2023, applicants may be able to submit a reusable tenant screening report with \ntheir applications  to participating landlords instead of repeatedly paying for consumer \nbackground checks .17 Landlords are not required to accept these reports, but if they do, \nthey are not permitted to collect an application screening fee or fee for accessing the report.  The report should include the  applicant\u2019s  a) name, b) contact information, c) \nverification of employment, d) last known address, and e) eviction history. \nCriminal History  \nGenerally, a housing provider may check the criminal history of an applicant, \nalthough there are some types of criminal history information that providers may not seek or consider. For example, landlords  are prohibited from considering certain types \nof criminal history including: 1) arrests that did not lead to a conviction 2) participation in a pretrial or post -trial diversion program 3) any record of a conviction that has been \nsealed by the court, or 4) any conviction that came from the juvenile justice s ystem.\n18 \n11  Landlords are also prohibit ed from having \u201cblanket bans\u201d on all applicants with criminal \nhistories.19 Landlords cannot be compelled by their local government s to perform \ncriminal background checks  or be penalized for failing to do so .20 \nInstead, landlords must look at the individual circumstances involving a conviction to \ndecide whether  it is directly  related to an applicant\u2019s  ability  to be a good tenant.21 For \nmore information please visit: \nhttps://www.dfeh.ca.gov/wpontent/uploads/sites/32/2020/04/CriminalHistoryWebinarRe  \nmediated.pdf . \nIf a housing provider intends to deny someone housing (or otherwise take an \nadverse action against someone) based on past criminal history, it must be based on a \npast criminal conviction. The law requires the landlord to follow certain guidelines. Most \nimportantly, the conviction the landlord is concerned about must be a \u201cdirectly -related \nconviction.\u201d This means a criminal conviction that has a direct and specific negative \nbearing on a substantial, legitimate, and nondiscriminatory interest or purpose of the housing provider, such as the safety of other residents, the housing provider\u2019s employees, or the property.  \nLandlords should be able to provide a copy of their policy on the use of criminal \nhistory information and offer you an opportunity to present additional (mitigating) \ninformation that could inform their decision. They should also delay considering criminal \nhistory information until after your financial and other qualifications have been verified.  \n \n \n \n     \n \n     \n \n    \n \n12   \nPrepaid Rental Listing Services  \n \nBusinesses known as \u201c prepaid rental listing services\u201d sell lists of available rental \nunits. These businesses  are regulated by the California Department of Real Es tate (DRE) \nand must be licensed.22 You may check the status of a license issued to a prepaid rental  \nservice on the DRE website ( www. dre.ca.gov ) to ensure that the service is licensed. A \nprepaid rental listing s ervice must enter into a contract with you before accepting any \nmoney from you.23 The contract must describe the services that the prepaid rental listing \nservice will provide you and the kind of rental unit that you want them to find. For \nexample, the contract must state the number of bedrooms in the unit that you want and \nthe highest rent that you are willing to pay. Contracts with prepaid rental listing services \ncannot be for more than 90 days.  \nBefore you enter into a contract with a prepaid rental listing service, check to see that \nthey are licensed and that their list of rentals is current. The law requires a prepaid rental \nlisting service to provide you with a list of at least three currently available rentals within five \ndays of entering into a contract. \nIf the list you purchased from a prepaid rental listing service does not contain three \navailable rental units of the kind that you described in the contract, you are entitled to a \nrefund.24 You must demand a refund from the prepaid rental listing service within 15 days \nof signing the contract. Your refund demand must be in writing and must be personally  \ndelivered to the prepaid rental listing service or  sent via certified or registered mail. (Note : \nyou are not entitled to a refund if you located a rental using the services of the prepaid rental listing service.)  \nIf you do not locate a rental unit from the list you purchased, or if you locate a rental \nthrough another source, the prepaid rental listing service can keep only $50 of the fee you \npaid. While you are entitled to a refund of the balance, you must request the refund in \nwriting within 10 days after the end of the contract. Your refund request must include \ndocumentation that you did not move or that you did not find your new rental using the services of the prepaid  rental  listing  service. If you cannot  provide this documentation,  you \ncan fill out and swear to a form that the prepaid rental listing service will give you for this purpose (or that you can locate yourself by reviewing the form language set forth in Business and Professions Code section 10167.10). You can deliver your request for a \nrefund personally or by mail (preferably by certified or registered mail with return receipt \nrequested).  Look  in the contract  for the mailing  address.  The service must  make the refund \nwithin 10 days after it receives your request, or they are subject to statutory and actual damages.  \n \n \n  \n \n13  Other Rental Application Considerations  \nIn the event the landlord does not accept a reusable tenant screening report from an \napplicant , the rental application may contain an authorization for the landlord to obtain a \ncopy of your credit report , which will show the landlord how you manage your financial \nobligations.  \nThe landlord may ask you questions about your employment, your monthly income, \nand other information to establish your ability to pay rent. It is illegal, however, for the \nlandlord to discriminate against you based upon sex, race, color, religion, ancestry , \nnational origin, disability, whether you have persons under the age of 18 living in your household, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, veteran or military status,\n25 age, medical condition, \ncitizenship, primary language, or immigration status.26 Other than your source of \nincome and the number of persons in your household and how many are adults, it is also unlawful for a landlord to ref use to rent to you based on having or planning t o \nhave a family child care home.\n27 A landlord may not ask you questions (either orally or \nin writing) about any  of these characteristics, including your immigration or citizenship \nstatus.28 \nBeginning July 2024, a new  California  law will allow applicants for government -\nsubsidized housing the option to establish financial eligibility  without providing a credit \nreport . Landlords accepting government rent subsidies  will have to offer applicants the \noption to verify credit by alternative  means  including, but not limited to, government \nbenefit payments, pay records  or bank statements.29  \nCalifornia and federal law also make  it illegal for landlords to discriminate against \npotential tenants because they are survivors of domestic violence ; doing so \ndisproportionately impacts women, who comprise the vast majority of survivors, giving \nrise t o a claim of sex discrimination.30 \nIn the context of a number of federally assisted housing programs, the Violence \nAgainst Women Act (VAWA) offers protections to applicants from being denied housing based on one\u2019s status as a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.\n31 VAWA protects survivors regardless of gender.  \nAlthough a landlord may not discriminate on the basis of the source of your income, \na landlord is allowed to ask you about your level of income and the source of your income.\n32  \nThe landlord may also ask you about the number of people who will be living in the \nrental unit. In order to prevent overcrowding of rental units, California has adopted the \nUniform Housin g Code\u2019s occupancy requirements.33 Generally, a landlord can establish \nreasonable standards for the number of people in a rental unit, but the landlord cannot use overcrowding as a pretext for refusing to rent to  tenants with children if the landlord \nwould rent the unit to the same number of adults.\n34 \nLandlords are  forbidden by law from asking questions about  your age or medical \ncondition (see \u201cUnlawful Discrimination,\u201d pages 18-22 ).35 \nLandlords are also prohibited from discriminating against a tenant by refusing to rent \nto someone on the basis that they receive Section 8 assistance or participate in other \nsimilar housing voucher programs.36 This means that a landlord now cannot refuse to \n14  accept a tenant on the basis that a tenant receives rental assistance from a voucher \nprogram.  \nCREDIT CHECKS  \nCredit reporting agencies (or \u201ccredit bureaus\u201d) keep records of people\u2019s credit \nhistories, called \u201ccredit reports.\u201d Credit reports state whether a person has a history of paying bills late, has been the subject of an unlawful detainer lawsuit (see pages 90 -\n104), or has filed for bankruptcy.\n37 The landlord or property manager will probably  use \nthe tenant\u2019s rental application to check their credit history and past landlord- tenant \nrelations. The landlord may obtain the tenant\u2019s credit report from a credit reporting \nagency to assist the landlord with the screening process. \nSome credit reporting agencies, called tenant screening services , collect and sell \ninformation about tenants. This information may include whether tenants paid their rent on time; damaged previous rental units; or were the subject of an unlawful detainer \nlawsuit (eviction lawsuit).\n38 Tenant screening services and landlords cannot use an \nalleged COVID -19 rental debt as a negative factor in their evaluation of a tenant .39 \nThe landlord may use this information to make a final decision on whether to rent to \nyou. Generally, landlords prefer to rent to people who have a history of paying their rent \nand bills on time. However, there are circumstances where the court seals the record of an eviction (called \u201cmasking\u201d). For example, the COVID -19 Tenant Relief Act masks \nunlawful detainer actions filed between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2021 based \non a failure to pay rent and civil  actions for recovery of COVID -19 rental debt .\n40 When \nthe record of an eviction is masked, credit reporting agencies are barred from  including \nthis information in a tenant screening report. Tenants can sometimes demonstrate \nrental history by presenting evidence of having paid rent on time and can demonstrate financial ability to pay by showing proof of income. \nA landlord usually does not have to give you a reason for refusing to rent to you.  \nHowever, if their decision is based partly or entirely on negative information from a credit reporting agency or a tenant screening service, the law requires the landlord to give you a written notice stating all of the following:  \n\u2022 The decision was based partly or entirely on information in such a report;  and \n\u2022 The name, address, and  telephone number of the credit reporting agency or \nscreening service; and \n\u2022 A statement that you have the right to obtain a free copy of the report relied upon \nfrom the reporting agency that prepared it and to dispute the accuracy or \ncompleteness of information contained in the credit  report.41\u202f\u202f \nIf the landlord refuses to rent to you based on your credit report, it is recommended \nthat you get a free copy of your credit report and correct any erroneous or fraudulent \ninformation that could lead to the further denials.42 Additionally, if you paid an application \nfee you have a right to request a copy of that credit report from the landlord.43 \nAlso, if you know what is contained in your credit report, you may be able to explain \nany problems when you fill out the rental application. For example, if you know that your \ncredit report says that you never paid a particular bill, you can provide a copy  of a \ncanceled check to show that you actually paid the bill.  \nYour credit score is also important. The landlord probably will consider your credit \n15  score in deciding whether to rent to you. Your credit score is a numerical score that is \nbased on information from a credit reporting agency. Landlords and other creditors use \ncredit scores to gauge how likely a person is to meet his or her financial obligations, such as paying rent. You can request your credit score when you request your credit report (you may have to pay a reasonable fee for your score) or purchase your score from a vendor.\n44 \nAPPLICATION SCREENING FEE  \nWhen you submit a rental application, the landlord may charge you an application \nscreening fee to cover the cost of obtaining information about you, such as checking \nyour personal references and obtaining a credit report about you.45 \nThe application screening fee cannot legally be more than the landlord\u2019s actual out -of- \npocket costs, including the cost of obtaining a consumer credit report, and the \nreasonable value for the time spent by the owner or the owner\u2019s agent in gathering \ninformation concerning the applicant. The amount is adjusted annually commensurate \nwith an increase in the Consumer Price Index.46 As of December 2022, the application \nscreening fee could exceed $59.67 .47 The landlord must give you a receipt that itemizes \nthe cost of obtaining and processing the information about you. The landlord must return \nany unused portion of the fee (for example, if the landlord does not check your \nreferences or does not run your credit).  \nThe landlord cannot charge you an application screening fee when the landlord knows \nor should know that there is no vacancy, or that there will be no vacancy within a \nreasonable time. However, the landlord is permitted to charge an application screening \nfee under these circumstances if you provide informed written consent.48 \nA landlord who has obtained your consumer credit report must provide you with a \ncopy of the report upon your request.49 As explained in the section on \u201cCredit Checks,\u201d it \nis recommended that you obtain a copy of your credit report from the landlord so that \nyou know what is being reported about you.  \nBefore paying an application screening fee, ask the landlord the following questions:  \n\u2022 How long will it take to get a copy of your credit  report?  \n\u2022 How long will it take to review the credit report and decide whether to rent to you? \n\u2022 Is the fee refundabl e if the credit check takes too long and you\u2019re forced to rent \nanother  place?  \n\u2022 If you already have a current copy of your c redit report, will the landlord accept it and \neither reduce the fee or not charge it at  all? \nIf you do not like the landlord\u2019s policy on application screening fees, you may want to \nlook for another rental unit. A landlord is required to return any unused portion of the \nscreening fee. If you decide to pay the application screening fee, any agreement \nregarding a refund should be in writing. \nHOLDING DEPOSIT  \nA holding deposit is a deposit tendered by the tenant/applicant and held by the \nlandlord to take an available rental unit off of the market while the applicant\u2019s application \nis being processed or, once the landlord has approved the application and the parties have signed a rental agreement, hold the rental unit available for a stated period of time \n16  if the tenant is unable to move in immediately. Most landlords utilize a holding deposit \nagreement, which the parties sign, to govern how the holding deposit will be used. The \nholding deposit agreement requires the landlord to take the rental unit off of t he market. \nIf the application is not approved, it will direct the landlord to refund the holding deposit. If the application is approved and the parties sign a rental agreement, it will direct the landlord either to apply the holding deposit towards the fi rst month\u2019s rent or security \ndeposit or refund the holding deposit. If the application is approved, but the applicant \nfails to sign the rental agreement, it may permit the landlord to retain some or all of the \nholding deposit.  \nAsk the following questions before you pay a holding deposit: \n\u2022 Will the deposit be applied to the first month\u2019s rent or security deposit? If the answer \nis yes, ask the landlord for a receipt and written confirmation of this agreement. \nApplying the deposit to the first month\u2019s rent is a common  practice.  \n\u2022 Is any part of the holding deposit refundable if you change your mind about renting? \nAs a general rule, if you change your mind, the landlord can keep some (and perhaps all) of your holding deposit. The amount that the landlord can keep depends \non the costs that the landlord incurred in holding the unit such as additional \nadvertising costs to find a new tenant or lost  rent.\n \nYou may also lose your deposit if something happens and you cannot pay rent (for \nexample, you lose your job).  \nIf you and the landlord agree that all or part of the deposit will be refunded in the \nevent that you change your mind or cannot move in, make sure that the written receipt \nclearly sets forth your agreement.  \nIf you make an agreement to pay a holding deposit, always get a copy of this \nagreement in writing. When you pay the deposit, ask for a written receipt.  \nA holding deposit merely guarantees that the landlord will not rent the unit to \nanother person for a stated period of time. It does not give the tenant the right to move into the rental unit. The tenant must pay the first month\u2019s rent and all other required deposits within the holding period before occupying the unit. \nOtherwise, the landlord can rent the unit to another person and keep all or part \nof the holding deposit, depending on the agreement.  \nSuppose that the landlord rents to somebody else during the holding deposit period, \nand you are still willing and able to move in. The landlord should, at a minimum, return the entire holding deposit to you. You may also want to talk with an attorney, legal aid organization, tenant -landlord program, or housing clinic about whether the landlord is \nresponsible for damages you incurred due to the loss of the rental unit.  \nIf you give the landlord a holding deposit when you submit your rental \napplication, but the landlord does not accept you as a tenant, the landlord must return the entire holding deposit.  \nUNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION  \nWhat is unlawful discrimination?  \nA landlord cannot refuse to rent to a tenant, or provide unequal terms to a tenant, for \n17  a discriminatory purpose. The law also safeguards certain protected classes from \ndiscrimination. In California, protected groups, or \u201cclasses\u201d, include:  \n\u2022 Race,  color  \n\u2022 Ancestry, national origin  \n\u2022 Religion  \n\u2022 Disability, mental or  physical  \n\u2022 Sex, gender  \n\u2022 Sexual  orientation  \n\u2022 Gender identity, gender  expression  \n\u2022 Genetic  information  \n\u2022 Marital status  \n\u2022 Familial status  \n\u2022 Source of income (including housing vouchers)  \n\u2022 Military or veteran  status  \nAdditionally, the Unruh Civil Rights Act, which applies to private housing, prohibits \ndiscrimination on the basis of citizenship, immigration status, primary language, age, \nmedical condition, or any other arbitrary personal characteristic.50 Discrimination on the \nbasis of specified personal characteristics, is also prohibited.51 Indeed, the California \nLegislature has  declared that the opportunity to seek, obtain, and hold housing free of \nunlawful discrim ination is a civil right protected under the United States and California \nConstitutions.52 \nDiscrimination can take many forms. Discrimination may mean treating a person or \npeople differently because of a particular protected characteristic. Examples of different \ntreatment could be a landlord failing to make repairs for tenants of a specific ethnicity or \nsingling out tenants over a certain age for eviction. Discrimination also includes actions that were not meant to be discriminatory but that harm protected groups.\n53 For example, \nhaving very strict rules against how many people can live in a housing unit may result in excluding many families with children.  \nUnder California law, it is unlawful for a landlord, managing agent, real estate broker, \nor salesperson to discriminate against or harass a person because of their race, color, \nreligion, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth or medical conditions related to them) \ndisability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, marital status, \nnational origin, ancestry, familial  status, source of income,  veteran or military status, or \ngenetic information disability.\n54 California law also prohibits discrimination based on any \nof the following:  \n\u2022 A person\u2019s age, medical condition, citizenship, primary language, immigration \nstatus,  or personal characteristics, such as a person\u2019s physical appear ance or other \ncharacteristics that may be termed as \u2018arbitrary\u2019 discrimination;55 \n\u2022 A perception of a person\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, gender \nexpression, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry, familial \nstatus, source of income, disability, veteran or military status, or genetic  information,  \n18  or a perception that a person is associated with another person who may \nhave any of these characteristics;  or56 \n\u2022 Having or planning to have a family childcare home.57 \nThere are several other state laws that prohibit landlords from enforcing improper \nlocal rules, regulations or policies.  A landlord cannot apply rules, regulations or policies \nto unmarried couples or couples who are registered domestic partners that do not apply \nto married couples.58 For example, if a landlord allows married couples to combine their \nincomes to qualify for a unit, the landlord must also allow people who are unmarried (i.e., domestic partners, s ame- sex couples, roommates, etc.) to combine their income to \nqualify on the same basis as married couples.  \nBeginning in 2024, landlords cannot apply local rules, regulations  or policies that \npenalize tenants for contact with law enforcement.\n59 For example, local governments \ncannot require landlords to perform criminal background checks on prospective tenants.  \nNeither can they require landlords to penalize or evict tenant s who have been arrested \nor investigated for alleged criminal conduct .  \nExcept as may be specifically required by federal law for certain housing programs, a  \nlandlord may not inquire as to the immigration or citizenship status of the tenant or \nprospective tenant, or require that a tenant or prospective tenant make any statement \nconcerning his or her immigration or citizenship status.60 However, a landlord can \nrequest information or documents in order to verify an applicant\u2019s identity and financi al \nqualifications.61 Whether or not a landlord can inquire about an existing or prospective \ntenant\u2019s immigration status, it is unlawful for a landlord for purposes of influencing a tenant to vacate his/her rental unit to threaten to disclose information regarding the immigrati on or citizenship status of a tenant, occupant , or other person associated with \nthe tenant or occupant.\n62 It also is unlawful for a landlord to harass, intimidate, or \nretaliate against an existing or prospective tenant by disclosing that person\u2019s immigration or citizenship status to federal, state or local law enforcement officials, including federal immigrati on officials.\n63 \nIn the case of a government rent subsidy, a landlord who is assessing a potential \ntenant\u2019s eligibility for a rental unit must use a financial or income standard that is based on the portion of  rent that the tenant would pay.\n64 In addition, the landlord must offer \nthe applicant the option to prove their creditworthiness by other verifiable means like government benefit records, pay records or bank statements .\n65 \nA landlord cannot apply special rules to family child care homes or refuse to rent to \nsomeone because they plan t o have a family child care home.66 Under California law, a \nfamily child care home is considered a residential use of property, not a business use.67 \nAny lease provisions directly prohibiting, restricting, or indirectly limiting the use of the \nproperty as a family child care home are void.68 Therefore, even if a lease says, for \nexample, \u201cfor residential use only\" or \u201cno businesses allowed,\u201d a tenant is not violating \ntheir lease by operating a family child care home because these lease provisions cannot be enforced. If your rights as a provider  under the above law are being violated, you can \nfile a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment & Housing. You can \nalso sue whoever is violating your rights as a family childcare provider.  \nIt is illegal for landlords to discriminate against families who have or care for children \n19  under the age of 18.69 However, housing for senior citizens may exclude families with \nchildren. \u201cHousing for senior citizens\u201d includes housing that is occupied only by persons \nwho are at least age 62, or housing that is operated for occupancy by persons who are at least age 55 and that meet other occupancy, policy, and reporting requirements \nstated in the law.\n70 \nLandlords also cannot discriminate against tenants due to their status, or \nperceived status, as a survivor of domestic violence, because this may be an \nexample of sex discrimination under both California and Federal law. These laws are subject to the lim ited exceptions described below.\n71 \nLimited exceptions for single rooms and roommates  \nIf the owner of an owner -occupied, single- family home rents out a single room in \nhis/her home to a roommate or boarder, and there are no other roommates or boarders \npaying rent to live in the household, with a limited exception, the owner is not subject to \nthe California Fair Employment and Housing Act of the federal Fair Housing Act.72 The \nexception is that the owner cannot make oral or written statements, or use notices or \nadvertisements which indicate any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on \nrace, color, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry, familial s tatus, source of income, \ndisability, veteran or military  status, or genetic information.\n73 Further, the owner cannot \ndiscriminate on the basis of age, medical condition, citizenship, primary language, \nimmigration status, mental or physical disability or personal characteristics, such as a \nperson\u2019s physical  appearance or other characteristics that may be termed as \u2018arbitra ry\u2019 \ndiscrimination .74 \nA person in a single- family dwelling who advertises for a roommate or a boarder may \nexpress a preference on the basis of sex, if living areas (such as the kitchen, living room, or bathroom)  will be shared by the roommate.\n75 This provision of the law does not permit \na person to advertise for a roommate regarding other preferences such as their religion, whether they are in college, or whether they have children. No law allows advertisement \nfor such preferences.  \nResolving housing discrimination problems  \nIf you are a victim of housing discrimination (for example, if a landlord refuses to rent \nto you because of your race or national origin), you may have several legal remedies, \nincluding:  \n\u2022 Recovery of out -of-pocket  losses.  \n\u2022 An injunction prohibiting the unlawful  practice.  \n\u2022 Access to housing that you were denied.  \n\u2022 Damages for emotional distress.  \n\u2022 Civil penalties or punitive  damages.  \n\u2022 Attorney\u2019s  fees. \nSometimes, a court may order the landlord to take specific action to stop unlawful \ndiscrimination. For example, the landlord may be ordered to advertise vacancies in minority or local newspapers, or place fair housing posters in the rental office.  \n20  A number of resources are available to help resolve housing discrimination problems:  \n\u2022 Local fair housing organizations (often known as fair housing councils). Look in the \nbusiness or commercial section of the phone book, use online resources, or dial 4-1- \n1 for directory assistance. The National Fair Housing Alliance maintains an \ninteractive map of local organizations that  advocate for fair housing at  \nhttps://nationalfairhousing.org/member- directory/ . \n\u2022 Landlords may look for local California apartment association chapters. Look in the \nbusiness or commercial section of the phone book. The California Apartment \nAssociation maintains a list of local apartment association chapters  at \nwww.caanet.org . \n\u2022 Local government agencies. Look in the governmental section of the phone book \nunder City or County Government Offices , search your city and county website for \nfair housing information, or call the offices of local elected officials (for example, your  \n \ncity council representative or your county supervisor) or dial 4-1- 1 for directory \nassistance.   \n\u2022 The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) \ninvestigates housing discrimination complaints (but not other kinds of landlord-\ntenant problems). DFEH enforces the Fair Employment and Housing Act which \nprohibits discrimination based upon the following categories: ancestry, national \norigin, marital status, citizenship, mental or physical disability, primary language, familial status, race,  color, gender identity, gender, religious expression, sex, \ngender, genetic information, sexual orientation, immigration status, and source of income. If you feel that you have been the subject of housing discrimination, contact DFEH. The DFEH Housing Enforcement Unit can be reached at (800) 884 -1684 \nTTY (800) 700- 2320. You can learn about DFEH\u2019s complaint proces s at \nhttps://www.dfeh.ca.gov/complaintprocess/ . \n\u2022 The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) enforces the  \nfederal fair housing law, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, race, color, \nreligion, national origin, familial status, and disability. Additionally, HUD's Equal \nAccess Rule requires equal access to HUD programs without regard to a  person's  \nactual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. To contact \nHUD, look in the governmental section of the phone book under United States \nGovernment Offices , or go to  www.hud.gov . \n\u2022 Legal aid organizations provide free legal advice, representation, and other legal \nservices in noncriminal cases to economically disadvantaged persons. Legal aid \norganizations are located throughout the state. Look in the business or commercial section of the phone book under Attorneys or go to  https://lawhelpca.org . The Legal \nAid Association of California also maintains a directory of legal aid organizations  at \nwww.laaconline.org , as does the Department of Real Estate at \nwww. housing.ca.gov . \n\u2022 Private attorneys. You may consider hiring a private attorney to take legal action \nagainst a landlord who has discriminated against you. For the names of attorneys \nwho specialize in housing discrimination cases, contact your county bar  association \nor an attorney referral service.  \n21  You must act quickly if you believe that a landlord has unlawfully discriminated \nagainst you. The time limits for filing housing discrimination complaints are short. For \nexample, a complaint to the DFEH must be filed within one year from the date of the \ndiscriminatory act.76 Make sure you document the unlawful discrimination when it occurs. \nFirst, write down what happened, including dates and the names of those  involved.  \nThen, contact one of the resources listed above for advice and help.  \n \n \nBEFORE YOU AGREE TO RENT  \n \n \nBefore you decide on a rental unit, there are several other points to consider. For \nexample: Is an oral rental agreement legally binding? What are the differences between \na lease and a rental agreement? What are some of the advantages and disadvantages \nof each? This section answers these and other questions. \nRENTAL AGREEMENTS AND LEASES  \nGeneral information  \nBefore a tenant can rent a rental unit, the landlord and tenant must enter into a rental \nagreement or lease . A \"lease\" generally refers to a written agreement while a \"rental \nagreement\" generally includes both oral and written agreement. However, these terms \nare synonymous and can be used interchangeably. For purposes of this guide, the term \"rental agreement\" is used to describe both a \"rental agreement\" and a \"lease\".  \nThe tenant\u2019s right to use and possess the landlord\u2019s rental unit is called a tenancy. \nThe rental agreement includes the terms and conditions that will govern the tenancy, including the length of the tenancy, the amount of the rent, the timing when the rent payments are due, and the amount of the security deposit. Although the different ty pes \nof rental agreements and tenancies are discussed below, before entering into an \nagreement with a landlord, the tenant may want to seek advice from an attorney, legal \naid organization, housing clinic, or tenant -landlord program to make sure that they \nunderstand all of the rental agreement provisions, each party's obligations, and any risks that either party may  face.  \nOral and Written Agreements  \nThe rental agreement may be oral or written, however, it is strongly recommended \nthat the parties have a written rental agreement. The landlord is required to provide the \ntenant with a signed copy of the rental agreement within 15 days of its execution. The landlord and tenant should retain copies of the signed rental agreement for their records.  \nAn oral agreement is an agreement where the terms are agreed upon by spoken \ncommunication. This is in contrast to a written agreement where the terms are set forth \nin a written document. A tenancy term of more than one year must be in writing.\n77 Oral \nagreements for a tenancy term of more than a year are unenforceable.78 \nIf you have an oral agreement, the landlord must give you a written statement \nregarding the name, street address, and phone number of the landlord or agent for \nreceipt of legal notices; the contact information for the person who will accept the rent; \nand how the rent is to be paid (for example by cash, check or money order).79 One \ndisadvantage of an oral agreement is that parties will have no written proof of the terms \n22  of their rental agreement if they get into a dispute with the other party. Also, once the \noral agreement is made, any change of its terms by a landlord, or its termination by \neither party, must still be made by a properly served and legally sufficient written \nnotice.80 \nTenants with special circumstances may especially want to avoid an oral agreement. \nFor instance, tenants may prefer a written agreement if they plan to reside at the rental \nunit for an extended period (i.e., several months up to one year), the landlord permits \nthe tenant to have pets or water -filled furniture (i.e., waterbed), or the landlord has \nagreed to pay any of the expenses (i.e., utilities or garbage removal) or provide any  \nservices (i.e., gardening).  \nAgain, a written agreement is preferred and is in the best interest of both parties. The \nkey problem with an oral agreement is that the obligations of the landlord to the tenant, and vice-a- versa, are not spelled out in an easily verifiable form.  \nFixed Term and Periodic Tenancies  \nWhether the parties choose an oral or written agreement, either agreement must \naddress the length of the tenancy or rental period. There are two types of tenancies, a \ntenancy for a fixed term and a tenancy for a periodic term. Fixed- term tenancies are \ntenancies that last for a set amount of time and have a defined expiration date, such as \nsix months or one year. It is important to understand that the tenant is bound by the agreement until the agreement expires, which means that the tenant must pay t he rent \nand perform all of the tenant's obligations under the agreement during the entire tenancy.\n81 There are some advantages to having a fixed- term tenancy. For instance, \nthe landlord cannot raise the tenant's rent during the tenancy, unless the rental agreement expressly allows rent increases. Also, the landlord cannot terminate the tenancy while the rental agreement is in effect unless the tenant breaches a term in the rental agreement (for example, the tenant fails to pay rent, damages the property, or \ncommits illegal activity on the premises). A fixed- term tenancy gives the tenant the \nsecurity of a long- term agreement at a known cost. Even if the rental agreement allows \nrent increases, the rental agreement should specify a limit on how much and how often \nthe rent can be raised. One disadvantage of a fixed- term tenancy is that the rental \nagreement may be more difficult to break, especially if another tenant cannot be found to take over your tenancy, if you need to move before the end of the fixed -term. If you \nmove before the fixed- term ends, you could be liable for the rent for the rest of the  term \nor until such time as the landlord rents the unit to a new tenant.\n82 \nPeriodic tenancies are tenancies that continue for successive periods until the \nlandlord or tenant gives the other party proper notification that they want to end the tenancy. Examples of periodic tenancies are tenancies that run from week to week or month to month. A period ic-term tenancy does not state the total number of weeks or \nmonths that the rental agreement will be in effect. The tenant can continue to live in the \nrental unit as long as the tenant continues to pay rent and the landlord does not prov ide \nproper notice of termination in a manner provided by law.  \nIf a tenant is protected by just cause eviction protections, a landlord cannot ask a \ntenant to leave for no reason even during a month -to-month tenancy. Many tenants have \ncity or county just cause eviction protections or have tenancies that qualify for evi ction \nprotections under the recently enacted Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (AB 1482) \n23  (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cTenant Protection Act\u201d). In these circumstances, a month - \nto-month tenancy will continue indefinitely unless a landlord has one of the good causes \nfor eviction specified in the law and gives the tenant a valid termination notice. \nAs for rental payments, the landlord and tenant should agree on the timing of the \nrental payments. Where the term of a tenancy for a rental unit is not specified, it is \npresumed to have been for the time period between rental payments.83 Thus, the term of \na periodic -term tenancy with rent paid monthly is presumed to be for month to  month.84 \nState law provides for the amount of advance notice that the landlord and tenant \nmust give to the other party to terminate the tenancy or change the terms (except the \nrental amount) of their rental agreement (see pages 64- 68).85  Special rules govern the \namount of advance notice that a landlord must give to a tenant before the landlord can \nincrease the rental amount, and by how much the rent can be increased (see pages 35 -\n37). \nSHARED UTILITY METERS  \nSome buildings have a single gas or electric meter that serves more than one rental \nunit. In other buildings, a tenant\u2019s gas or electric meter may also measure gas or \nelectricity used in a common area, such as the laundry room or the lobby. In situations \nlike these, the landlord must disclose that utility meters are shared before you sign the \nrental agreement or lease, or as soon as the landlord discovers the shared metering.86 \nWhen utilities are apportioned among multiple rental units, a tenant may consider asking \nthe landlord to provide them with information about how the charges are apportioned. A landlord cannot charge more than the actual cost of the utilities.  \nThe landlord and tenant should discuss and agree upon which party will be \nresponsible for paying the shared utilities and memorialize their understanding in writing. The options available to the landlord and tenant include:  \n\u2022 The landlord can pay for the utilities provided through the meter for your rental unit  \nby placing the utilities in the landlord\u2019s  name;  \n\u2022 The landlord can have the utilities in the area outside your rental unit put on a  \nseparate meter in the landlord\u2019s name;  or \n\u2022 You can agree to pay for the utilities provided through the meter for your rental unit  \nto areas outside your rental unit.\n87\u202f \nIf the landlord fails to do this, the tenant may bring a legal action and ask for \nremedies such as an order that the utilities be put in the landlord's name, or that the \ntenant be compensated for the tenant's payment of util ities outside the dwelling \nunit.88 If a public municipal utility company provides utility service to a rental \ndwelling, and the utility service is in the landlord\u2019s name, a tenant may be able to \nbecome the customer of record on the a ccount in order to avoid utility shut -off if the \nlandlord falls behind on payments.89 \nRental units in older buildings may not have separate water meters or submeters. Ask \nthe landlord if the rental unit that you plan to rent has its own water meter or submeter. If \nit does not, and if the landlord will bill you for water or sewer utilities, be sure that you \nunderstand how the landlord will calculate the  amount that you will be billed.90 Under  \nCalifornia law, a landlord is required to make specific disclosures to  a tenant about the \nbilling of water when there is a water submeter for the rental unit.91 \n24  Translation of Proposed Rental Agreement  \nAlthough most lease negotiations are conducted in English, English may not be the \nprimary language spoken by some landlords and tenants. Parties to a rental agreement \nmay negotiate in another language. If the parties specifically negotiate in Spanish, \nChinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese or Korean, the landlord must give the tenant a written translation of the proposed written agreem ent in the language used in the negotiation \nbefore the tenant signs the agreement.\n92 This rule applies whether the negotiations are \noral or in writing. The rule does not apply if the rental agreement is for a period of one \nmonth or less. This rule only applies if Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese or \nKorean is used. It does not apply if  the parties negotiate in some other language, such \nas Russian.  \nThe landlord must give the tenant the written translation of the rental agreement \nwhether or not it is requested by the tenant. The translation must include every term and \ncondition in the rental agreement, but may retain elements in English such as names,  \naddresses, numerals, dollar amounts and dates. It is never acceptable for the landlord to \ngive the written translation of the rental agreement to the tenant after the tenant has \nsigned the lease. Rather, the landlord must provide the tenant with the written translation of the rental agreement prior to the execution, or signing, of the rental agreement.  \nHowever, the landlord is not required to give the tenant a written translation of the \nlease or rental agreement if all of the following are true: \n\u2022 The Spanish- , Chinese- , Tagalog- , Vietnamese -, or Korean- speak ing tenant negotiated \nthe rental agreement through his or her own interpreter;  and \n\u2022 The tenant\u2019s interpreter is able to speak fluently and read with full understanding \nEnglish, as well as Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, or Korean (whichever \nlanguage is used in the negotiation);  and \n\u2022 The interpreter is not a minor (under 18 years of age);  and \n\u2022 The interpreter is not employed or made available by or through the  landlord.  \nIf a landlord who is required to provide a written translation of a lease or rental \nagreement in one  of these languages fails to do so, the tenant can  rescind (cancel) the \nagreement.93 \n \n \nWHEN YOU HAVE DECIDED TO RENT  \n \n \nBefore signing a rental agreement or a lease, the parties should read it carefully so \nthat each party understands all of its terms. What kind of terms should be included in the \nrental agreement or lease? Can the rental agreement or lease limit the basic rights that the law gives to all tenants? How much can the landlord require you to pay as a security deposit? This section answers these and other  questions.  \nWHAT THE RENTAL AGREEMENT SHOULD INCLUDE  \nMost landlords use printed forms for their rental agreements, however, printed forms \nmay vary from form to form. There is no standard rental agreement. Some agreements \nmay have terms that are only invoked through the checking of a box, placing a party\u2019s \n25  initials or otherwise marking the agreement. Also, some sections may require filling in \none or more blanks before a term is complete and understandable. Therefore, carefully \nread and understand the entire document before signing it. And make sure you are given a complete and exact copy to keep before signing it. Do not sign an agreement on which any relevant blanks are not completed. \nThe written rental agreement should contain all of the promises that the landlord or \nthe landlord\u2019s agent has made to you and should not contain anything that contradicts what the landlord or the agent told you. If the rental agreement refers to a separate  \ndocument, such as \u201ctenant rules and regulations,\u201d get a copy and read it before you sign the written agreement.  \nDo not feel rushed into signing. Make sure that you understand every term before \nsigning the rental agreement. If you do not understand something, ask the landlord to explain it to you. If you still do not understand, discuss the agreement with an attorney , \nlegal aid organization, tenant -landlord program, or housing clinic before signing it. \nKey terms  \nThe written rental agreement should contain key terms, such as the following:  \n\u2022 The names of the landlord and the tenant.  \n\u2022 The address of the rental  unit. \n\u2022 The amount of the rent. \n\u2022 When the rent is due, to whom it is to be paid, and where it is to be paid. \n\u2022 The amount and purpose of the security deposit (see pages  74-76). \n\u2022 The amount of any late charge or returned check fee (see page 40). \n\u2022 Whether pets are al lowed. The law does not treat assistance animals and service \nanimals as pets.  \n\u2022 The number of people allowed to live in the rental unit. \n\u2022 Whether attorney\u2019s fees can be collect ed from the losing party in the event of a \nlawsuit between you and the  landlord.  \n\u2022 Who is responsible for paying utilities (gas, electric, water, and trash collection).94 \n\u2022 If the rent al is a house or a duplex with a yard, who is responsible for taking care of \nthe yard.  \n\u2022 Any promises by the  landlord to make repairs, including the date by which the repairs \nwill be  completed.  \n\u2022 Contact information for reporting p roblems or necessary maintenance or repairs, \nincluding an emergency  number.  \n\u2022 Other items, such as whether you can sublet the rental unit (see page 45- 46) and the \nconditions under which the landlord can enter the rental unit (see pages  44-45). \n  In addition, the rental agreement must disclose:  \n\u2022 The name, address, and telephone number of the authorized manager of the rental \nproperty and an owner (or an agent of the owner) who is authorized to receive legal \nnotices for the owner.  \n26  \u2022 If you may make your rent payment in person, the rental agreement must state the \nusual days and hours that rent may be paid in person. Or the document may state \nthe name, street address, and account number of the financial institution where rent \npayments may be made (if it is within five miles of the unit) or information \nnecessary to establish an electronic funds transfer for paying the rent.  \n\u2022 The form  in which rent payments must be made (for example, by check or  money  \norder).95 Except when there has been an issuance of a 3- Day Notice to Pay Rent or \nQuit or a dishonored payment instrument, the landlord cannot require that you make \nrent payments in cas h, or by electronic funds transfer, without offering other options \n(see pages 38- 39).96 A tenant should never  pay rent in cash without getting a receipt \nevery single time.  \n\u2022 Certain required disclosures, including bed bugs and flood hazards.97 \nIf the rental agreement is oral, the landlord or the landlord\u2019s agent must give the \ntenant, within 15 days, a written statement containing the information in the foregoing three bullet points. The tenant may request a copy of this written statement each year \nthereafter.\n98 \nEvery rental agreement also must contain a written notice that the California \nDepartment of Justice maintains a website at www.meganslaw.ca.gov  that provides \ninformation about spe cified registered sex offenders. This notice must contain the legally \nrequired language.99 \nA rental agreement may contain other terms. Examples include whether you must \npark your car in a certain place, pool or clubhouse hours, whether storage is available, \nor when quiet hours begin. A landlord may lawfully prohibit smoking anywhere on the rental property. If the landlord chooses to do so, then the rental agreement must specify where on the property smoking is prohibited. If a landlord chooses to prohibit smoking \nafter a rental agreement  is entered into, the landlord must provide you with adequat e \nnotice of this change.\n100 A landlord cannot prevent you from posting political signs \ninvolving, for instance, noncommercial messages associated with people or issues up \nfor public vote. As long as the sign is less than six square feet in size and is not \notherwise prohibited by law, it may be posted. If no local ordinance gives time limits for how long you may post the sign, your landlord may establish a reasonable time lim it for \nthe posting and removal of the sign. A \u201creasonable\u201d time period means at least 90 days before the election or vote to which the sign refers and at least 15 days after.\n101 \nIt is important that you understand all of the terms of your rental agreement before \nyou sign it. If you do not comply with them, the landlord may have grounds to evict you.  \nDo not sign a rental agreement if you think that its terms are unfair or you believe that \none or more terms violate the law. If a term does not fit your needs, try to negotiate a \nmore suitable term (for example, a smaller security deposit or a lower late f ee). It is \nimportant that any agreed- upon change in terms be included in the rental agreement that \nboth you and the landlord sign. If you and the landlord agree to change a term in the \nrental agreement, the change can be made in handwriting. Both you and the landlord should initial or sign in the area immediately next to the change to show your approval of the change. Alternatively, the document can be retyped with the new term included \ntherein but will need to be signed by all the parties.  \nIf you do not agree with a term in the rental agreement and cannot negotiate a better \nterm, carefully consider the importance of the term, and decide whether or not you want \n27  to sign the document.  \nThe owner of the rental unit or the person who signs the rental agreement on the \nowner\u2019s behalf must give you a copy of the document within 15 days after you sign it.102 \nBe sure that your copy shows the signature of the owner or the owner\u2019s agent, in \naddition to your signature. Keep the document in a safe place and do not ever discard it. \nA good idea is to email a scanned copy to yourself. Tenants are also entitled to receive \none copy of the lease from the landlord every calendar year upon request.  \n \nAlterations to Accommodate a Tenant with a Disability  \n \nUnder fair housing laws, housing providers must make reasonable exceptions to neutral \npolicies, practices or services, or to make certain reasonable physical modifications when \nnecessary to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a \ndwelling. A reasonable accommodation could include changing the rental due date or waiving a no animals policy in order to allow a service or emotional support animal to reside in the unit. A landlord must also allow a tenant with a disability to m ake reasonable \nmodifications - physical changes - to the premises to the extent necessary to allow the  \ntenant \u201cfull enjoyment of the premises.\u201d\n103 Except at properties that receive \u2018federal financial \nassistance\u2019, as that term is defined by law, the tenant must pay for the modifications.  \nHowever, the landlord is required to make structural modifications if required by a separate provision of the law related to structural access standards. It is important to recognize that a modification is distinct from a reasonable accommodation - a change to a policy or practice - \nwhich the property owner cannot charge for , even if they involve some costs. As a condition \nof making certain modifications, the landlord may require the tenant to enter into an agreement to restore the interior of the rental unit to its previous condition at the end of the tenancy. Yet, most modifications will not require restoration. The landlord cannot require an additional security deposit in this situation. However, the landlord can require that some form of financial guarantee be put in place that is sufficient to pay for the properly required restoration. This can take the form of requiring that the tenant pay into an interest -bearing  \nescrow account, over a reasonable period, a reasonable amount of money not to exceed the cost of the restorations, where the interest in any such account shall accrue to  the \nbenefit of the tenant.\n104 \nAssistance animals and service animals, used by persons with disabilities as a \nreasonable accommodation for a disability, are not pets and are not subject to a no pets policy. A refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services when these accommodations may be necessary to afford a person with disabilities equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling, violates fair housing laws.  \nFor more information on reasonable accommodations, review \nhttps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2010/12/14/joint_statement_ra.pdf and \nhttps://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/reasonable_modifications_mar08.pdf . \n \n Tenant\u2019s basic legal rights \nTenants have basic legal rights that are always present , no matter what the rental \nagreement states. These rights include all of the following:  \n28  \u2022 Limits on the amoun t of the security deposit that the landlord can require you to pay \n(see pages  31-34). \n\u2022 As of January 1, 2020, most rental units are covered by the Tenant Protection Act \nwhich places a cap on annual rent increases equal to 5% plus inflation, or 10%, \nwhichever is lower, and  no more than two rental increases within a 12- month period \n(see page 35- 37).105 Tenants living in cities with rent stabilization programs might \nhave additional rent protections available to them. See Appendix 2 in this guidebook \nfor a comprehensive list of California cities and counties with rent stabilization \nprotections.  \n\u2022 Limits on the landlord\u2019s right to enter the rental unit (see pages  44-45). \n\u2022 The right to a refund of the security deposit, or a written accounting  of how any of it \nwas used by the landlord, after you move out ( see pages  74-77). \n\u2022 The right to sue the landlord for violations of the law, or your rental  agreement.  \n\u2022 The right to repair serious defects in the rental unit and to deduct certain repair costs \nfrom the rent, under appropriate circumstances, provided the tenant gives the \nlandlord reasonable advance notice (see pages  51-60). \n\u2022 The right to withhold rent under appropriate circumstances (see pages  55-57). \n\u2022 Rights under the warranty of habitability (see pages  47-50). \n\u2022 The right  to the implied rental agreement covenant of \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019 (see pages \n61-62). \n\u2022 Protection against retaliatory eviction (see pages  102-104). \n\u2022 Most tenants are protected from being evicted without just cause, which means that the \nlandlord must have a valid legal reason for an eviction (see pages 67- 68, AB 1482).  \n\u2022 Right to request a reasonable accommodation.  \n\u2022  Right to fair housing rights and protections against unlawful discrimination. \nThes e and other rights will be discussed throughout the rest of this  booklet.  \nThe duty of good faith and fair dealing  \nEvery rental agreement requires that the landlord and tenant deal with each other fairly \nand in good faith. Essentially, this means that both the landlord and the tenant must treat each other honestly and reasonably. This duty of good faith and fair dealing is implied by \nlaw in every rental agreement even though the duty is typically not  expressly stated in the \nagreement. A typical legal description of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is that neither party will do anything that will unreasonably interfere with the right \nof the other party to receive the benefits of the agreement. To put it another way, the implied covenant imposes upon each party the obligation to do everything that the \ncontract presupposes they will do to accomplish its purpose.\n106 \n LANDLORD\u2019S DISCLOSURES  \nThere are many state- wide disclosures landlords are required by law to make prior to \nthe tenancy commencing. There may be other local disclosure requirements depending \non the city or county in which the rental unit is located. These required disclosures of ten \nshow up as Addendums or Attachments to lease agreements. Here are some you may encounter.  \n29  Lead- based paint  \nIf the rental unit was constructed before 1978, the landlord must comply with all of the \nfollowing requirements:  \n\u2022 The landlord must disclose the presence of known lead- based paint and lead- based \npaint hazards in the dwelling before the tenant signs the rental agreement.107 The \nlandlord must also give the tenant a copy of the federal government\u2019s  pamphlet,  \n\u201cProtect Your Family From Lead in Your Home\u201d (available by calling (800) 424- \nLEAD, or online at https://www.epa.gov/lead/pro tect-your-family -lead-your-home), \nbefore the tenant signs the rental agreement.108 \n\u2022 The landlord i s not required to conduct any evaluation of the lead- based paint, or to \nremove  it.109 \n\u2022 The rental agr eement must contain a lead warning statement in legally -required \nlanguage.110 \n\u2022 The landlord also must give tenants and potential tenants a written D isclosure of \nInformation on Lead- Based Paint and/or Lead- Based Paint  Hazards.111 \nPeriodic pest control treatments  \nA pest control company must give written notice to the landlord and tenants of rental \nproperty regarding pesticides to be used when the company provides an initial treatment  \nas part of an ongoing pest -control service contract. The landlord must give a copy of this \nnotice to every new tenant who will occupy a rental unit that will be serviced under the \nservice contract. If the landlord fails to do so, the new tenant might be able to sue the landlord for costs incurred, moving costs, and an additional penalty  of up to $2,500.\n112 \nBed Bugs \nPrior to creating a new tenancy for a dwelling unit, a landlord must provide a written \nnotice to a prospective tenant about bed bugs. The required notice must include general information about bed bug identification, behavior and biology, the importance of  \ncooperation for prevention and treatment, and the importance of, and for prompt written \nreporting of, suspected infestations to the landlord. If a landlord suspects that a rental unit contains bed bugs, or if they somehow learn of a possible bed bug infes tation, the \nlandlord must inspect the rental unit for bed bugs.\n113 If bed bugs are found, a landlord \ncannot show, rent or lease the rental unit until the bed bugs are eradicated.114 \nAsbestos  \nResidential property built before 1981 may contain asbestos. Landlords of properties \nbuilt before 1981 must disclose the presence of asbestos whenever they discover or \nreasonably suspect the presence of asbestos at the property.115 \nCarcinogenic material  \nIn 1986, California voters approved the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement \nAct of 1986 (known as \u201cProposition 65\u201d). The act requires any person or entity with 10 or more employees to provide a warning of possible exposure to chemicals (listed by the \nState of California) that cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm if that \nperson or entity knows or suspects the chemical is present at a workplace, business or rental housing. Examples of listed chemicals include, but are not limited to, a rsenic, \nasbestos, benzene, and lead. For landlords with 10 or more employees, the landlord \n30  must provide the notice in one or more conspicuous locations at the rental property to \nwarn tenants, prospective tenants and others of possible exposure to the listed \nchemical. For more information, please visit the State of California\u2019s Proposition 65 website at  https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/ .\u201d \nMethamphetamine contamination  \nResidential property that was used for methamphetamine production may be \nsignificantly contaminated.  \nA local health officer who inspects a rental property and finds that it is contaminated \nwith a hazardous chemical related to methamphetamine laboratory activities must issue \nan order prohibiting the use or occupancy of the property. This order must be served on \nthe property owner and all occupants. The owner and all occupants then must vacate \nthe affected units until the officer sends the owner a notice that the property requires no further action.  \nThe owner must give written notice of the health officer\u2019s order and a copy of it to \npotential tenants who have completed an application to rent the contaminated property. Before signing a rental agreement, the tenant must acknowledge in writing that they received the notice and order. The tenant may void (cancel) the rental agreement if the owner does not comply with these requirements. The owner must comply with these requirements until they receive a notice from the health officer that the property requi res \nno further  action.\n116 \nDemolition  permit  \nThe owner of a dwelling who has applied for a permit to demolish the dwelling must \ngive written notice of this fact to a prospective tenant before accepting any fee from the \ntenant or entering into a rental agreement with the tenant. (The owner must give notice to current tenants, including tenants who have yet to move in, before applying for a permit.) The notice must state the earliest approximate date that the owner expects the demolition to occur, and that the tenancy will end.\n117 \nMilitary base or explosives \nA landlord who knows that a rental unit is within one mile of a closed military base in \nwhich ammunition or military explosives were used must give written notice of this fact to \na prospective tenant. The landlord must give the tenant this notice before the tenant \nsigns a rental agreement.118 \nDeath in the rental unit  \nCalifornia law requires a landlord to disclose to a prospective tenant a death and the \nmanner of such death that occurred at the rental unit within the last three years. The \nlandlord is not required to disclose that an occupant of the rental unit was living with human immunodeficiency virus (\u201cHIV\u201d) or died from AIDS- related complications. The law \ndoes not protect an owner, however, from liability for making any intentional misrepresentations in response to a direct inquiry from  a prospective tenant who asked \nabout a death at the rental unit.\n119 \nCondominium conversion project  \nA rental unit may be in a condominium conversion project. A condominium conversion \n31  project is an apartment building that has been converted into condominiums or a newly \nconstructed condominium building that replaces demolished residential housing. Before \nthe potential tenant signs a rental agreement, the owner or subdivider of the condom inium project must give the tenant written notice that:  \n\u2022 The unit has been approved for sale, and may be sold, to the public,  and \n\u2022 The tenant\u2019s rental agreement may be terminated (ended) if the unit is sold,  and \n\u2022 The tenant will be informed at least 90 days before the unit is offered for sale,  and \n\u2022 The tenant normally will be given a first option to buy the  unit. \nThe notice must be in legally required language. This notice requirement applies only \nto condominium conversion projects that have five or more dwelling units and that have received final approval.\n120 If the notice is not given, the tenant may recover actual \nmoving expenses not exceeding $1,100 and the first month\u2019s rent on the tenant\u2019s new rental unit, if any, not to exceed $1,100. These notice provisions do not apply a) to \nprojects of four dwelling units or less, or b) as a result of transfers due to court order \n(including probate  proceedings), foreclosure proceedings, or trusts.\n121 \nIn some cities, additional requirements for condominium conversion may apply, or \ncertain types of condominium conversions may be prohibited.  \nFlood Hazard  \nIn all rental agreements entered into after July 1, 2018, if the owner has actual \nknowledge that the rental unit is located in a flood hazard zone, the landlord must \ndisclose to the tenant that they live in a special flood hazard area or an area of potential \nflooding.122 \nMegan\u2019s Law  \nA landlord must include the following language in every rental agreement : \"Notice: \nPursuant to Section 290.46 of the Penal Code, information about specified registered \nsex offenders is made available to the public via an Internet Web site maintained by the \nDepartment of Justice at www.meganslaw.ca.gov . Depending on an offender's criminal \nhistory, this information will include either the address at which the offender resides or the community of residence and ZIP Code in which he or she resides.\"\n123 \nBASIC RULES GOVERNING SECURITY DEPOSITS  \nAt the beginning of the tenancy, the landlord can, and most likely will, require you to \npay a security deposit . The landlord can use the security deposit, for example, if you \nmove out owing rent, damage the rental unit beyond nor mal wear and tear, or leave the \nrental unit less clean than when you moved in.124 \nUnder California law, a rental agreement cannot say that a security deposit is \nnonrefundable.125 This means that when the tenancy ends, the landlord must return to \nyou any payment that is a security deposit, unless the landlord uses the deposit for a \nlawful purpose, as described on pages 68- 70 and 74- 76. \nAlmost all landlords charge tenants a security deposit. The security deposit may be \ncalled last month\u2019s rent, security deposit, pet deposit, key fee, or cleaning fee. The \nsecurity deposit can even be a combination of fees. No matter what these payments or \nfees are called, the law considers them all, as well as any other deposit or  charge, to be \n32  part of the security deposit.126  \nThe law limits the total amount that the landlords and small landlords  (as defined \nbelow)  can require you to pay as a security deposit. Beginning July 1, 2024, landlords  \nwill be limited to an amount of no more than one month\u2019s rent  that they can charge as a \nsecurity deposit.127 This new law applies to furnished and unfurnished residences. The \nlaw does not allow for exceptions for pet deposits, key fees, or cleaning fees. For \nexample, there is no allowance for an additional pet deposit for tenants living with a service or emotional support animal. Regardless of the landlord\u2019s justification or name for any other deposits or charges, the law considers them all to be part of the security \ndeposit and limited to an amount equal to one month\u2019s rent.\n128  \nOnly small landlords can charge more for a security deposit. Small landlords can \ncharge up to two month\u2019s rent for a security deposit.129 They are defined as individual \npeople or limited liability companies owned by people that own and rent one or two \nproperties containing no more than 4 rental units.  \nTenants should not believe that their security deposit somehow constitutes pre -\npayment for their last month\u2019s rent \u2013 even if their landlord has used this term with \nrespect to the security deposit. The landlord will almost always be able to insist a tenant pay rent for their last month or partial portion thereof. \n \nEXCEPTION: Application screening fee  The law permits a  landlord to collect from  a tenant an \napplication screening fee, in addition to the security deposit (see pages 15- 16).\n130 The application \nscreening fee is intended  to cover the cost of obtaining information about you, such as checking \nyour personal references and obtaining your credit report (see pages 15 -16). The application \nscreening fee is not part of the security deposit  and is not refundable as part of the security  \ndeposit. However, any other fee charged by the landlord at the beginning of the tenancy to cover \nthe landlord\u2019s costs of processing a new tenant is part of the security deposit.131  \n \nSecurity deposit scenarios : \n\u2022 Suppose that you agreed to rent an unfurnished apartment for $1,000 a month.  \nBefore you move in, the landlord can only require you to pay up to one month\u2019s rent  \nas a security deposit ($1,000). The landlord also can require you to pay the first \nmonth\u2019s rent of $1,000, plus an application screening fee of up to $52.46, in addition to the $1 ,000 security deposit. This is because the first month\u2019s rent and the \napplication screening fee are not part of the security deposit.  \n\u2022 Suppose the landlord requires you to pay $1 ,000 security deposit (the maximum  \nallowed by law for an unfurnished unit when the rent is $1,000). The landlord cannot \nthen add to this $1,000 deposit additional deposit fees such as another $200 cleaning fee, $25 key deposit, $50 mailbox  deposit fee, or other similar fees.  The \n$1,000 plus the added fees would be prohibited by state law.  \nA landlord cannot require that a security deposit be nonrefundable.\n132 However, when \nyou move out of the rental, the law allows the landlord to keep all or part of the security \ndeposit for the following:  \n\u2022 You owe rent;  \n\u2022 You leave the rental less clean than when you moved in; \n33  \u2022 You damaged the rental beyond normal wear and  tear; \n\u2022 You have made alterations and did not return the unit to the original condition;  or \n\u2022 You fail to restore personal  property (such as keys or furniture), other than because \nof normal wear and tear. \nIf none of these circumstances are present, the landlord must return the entire amount \nthat you paid as security. However, if you left the rental very dirty or damaged beyond \nnormal wear and tear, for example, the landlord could keep an amount that is reasonably \nnecessar y to clean or repair the rental.133 Deductions from  security deposits and the time \nperiods when the landlord must notify the tenant of any deductions are discussed in \ndetail on pages 71- 76. \nMake sure that your rental agreement clearly states that you paid a security deposit to \nthe landlord and correctly states the amount that you paid. Most landlords will give you a \nwritten receipt for all amounts that you pay as a security deposit. Keep a copy of both the receipt, if any, and your rental agreement in case of a dispute.\n134 \nCalifornia law provides survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, human \ntrafficking, stalking, or elder/dependent adult abuse the ability to terminate their lease \nearly without penalty. A landlord may not charge a tenant a penalty for breaking their \nlease, regardless of what is stated in their lease, if the tenant is breaking their lease \nbecause of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, stalking, or elder/dependent adult abuse. The tenant must tell the landlord in writing that they are ending the rental agreement early because of the domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, stalking, or elder/dependent adult abuse they\u2019ve experienced, and provide the landlord a copy of a restraining order no more than 180 days old, a police \nreport no more than 180 days old, or a statement from a qualified third -party. Qualified \nthird parties include domestic violence or sexual assault advocates, doctors, registered \nnurses, psychologists, or licensed clinical social workers. However, the landlord can require the tenant to pay rent for 14 days after providing this notice (which must be refunded if the landlord re- rents the unit within that time). Tenants can also break their \nlease early if it is necessary because the tenant\u2019s household member is  a survivor of \ndomestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, stalking,  or elder/dependent adult \nabuse.\n135 The National Housing Law Project has created an Early Lease Termination \nToolkit, available at: https://www.nhlp.org/wp -content/uploads/00 -CA-Civil- Code- 1946.7-  \nToolkit -Jan-2016updated.pdf . \nNormal security deposit law applies in cases where a survivor  has to break their lease \nearly.136 In addition, if the tenant is a survivor of domestic violence, a landlord may not \npenalize the tenant for property damage, nor deduct the cost from the security deposit to \nrepair those damages, caused by the domestic violence survivor\u2019s abuser if the domes tic violence survivor (i.e., tenant) did not invite the abuser onto the property.\n137 \nIf your building changes owners during your tenancy, your prior landlord is \nresponsible for either transferring your security deposit to your new landlord or returning \nthe security deposit to you, minus any lawful deductions.138 \nIf your landlord fails to return part or all of a security deposit without having a reason \nallowed by law, you may be able to recover your deposit in court, such as by filing a \nlawsuit in small claims court.139 If the landlord withheld the security deposit in bad faith, \n34  the court may award the tenant up to twice the amount of the security deposit, plus \nany monetary damages that the tenant suffered.140 \nTHE INVENTORY CHECKLIST  \nWhile not legally required, it is a good practice for you and the landlord, or the \nlandlord\u2019s agent, to fill out the Inventory Checklist, such as the example on pages 123- 126 (or one like it). Generally, the landlord will have such a form available.  It is best to do \nthis before you move in, but it can be done two or three days later, if agreed to by the \nlandlord. You and the landlord or agent should walk through the rental unit together and note the condition of the items included in the checklist in the \u201cCondition Upon Arrival\u201d \nsection. In addition to noting conditions on the checklist, it is recommended that you take pictures of conditions needing attention. \nBoth the landlord and tenant should sign and date the checklist, and both of you \nshould keep a copy. Carefully completing the checklist at the beginning of the tenancy \nwill help avoid disagreements about the condition of the unit when you move out. You \nshould complete the Inventory Checklist and take pictures of any issues even if the landlord does not want to complete a walk through with you. \nSee additional suggestions about the Inventory Checklist on page 81 . \nRENTER\u2019S INSURANCE  \nRenter\u2019s insurance protects the tenant\u2019s personal property from losses caused by \nfire or theft. It also protects a tenant against liability (legal responsibility) for many claims or lawsuits filed by the landlord or others alleging that the tenant negligently (carelessly) injured another person or damaged the person\u2019s property. Renter\u2019s insurance usually \nonly protects the policyholder. A roommate must take out his or her own renter's insurance policy to protect his or her personal property. Many landlords w ill require a \ntenant to have renter\u2019s insurance, specifically liability coverage, and will set the minimum terms of coverage. Be sure to factor the cost of this insurance into what it will cost you to live in the property.  \nAccidentally leaving on a portable room heater which causes a fire that destroys the \nrental unit, or another tenant\u2019s property, is an example of negligence for which the \ntenant could be held legally responsible.\n141 The tenant could be required to pay for the \nlosses that the landlord or other tenants suffer due to the tenant\u2019s negligence. Renter\u2019s \ninsurance would cover some or all of your liability to pay the other party their losses. For that reason, it is recommended that a tenant purchase renter\u2019s insurance.\n142 \nNote, however, that several cases in rent control jurisdictions have held that the \nlandlord cannot evict a tenant for the tenant\u2019s failure to purchase tenant insurance that  \ncovers their own possessions.143 \nIf the tenant elects to purchase renter\u2019s insurance, the tenant should make certain that \nit provides the protection the tenant wants, meets any requirements set by the landlord, \nand is reasonably priced. The tenant should check with more than one insurance company, since the price and type of coverage may differ widely among insurance \ncompanies. The price also will be affected by how much insurance protection you decide \nto purchase.  \nYour landlord probably has insurance that covers the rental unit or dwelling, but you \nshould not assume that the landlord\u2019s insurance will protect you. If the landlord\u2019s \n35  insurance company pays the landlord for a loss that you cause, the insurance company \nmay then sue you to recover what it has paid the  landlord.  \nIf you want to use a waterbed, or you have pets, the landl ord can require you to obtain \nan insurance policy to cover possible property  damage.144 \nLandlords also cannot require that family childcare providers get liability insurance. \nHowever, a family childcare provider must add their landlord to their liability insurance \npolicy if the following conditions are met:  \n\u25cf The family childcare provider already has or is getting a liability  insurance \npolicy;  \n\u25cf The landlord asks in writing to be added to the family childcare provider\u2019s \ninsurance policy;  \n\u25cf The insurance policy will not be canceled if the landlord is added,  and \n\u25cf The landlord will pay the additional amount if adding them causes the family \nchildcare provider to pay a higher  premium.145 \nLIMITS TO RENT INCREASES AND LOCAL RENT STABILIZATION PROGRAMS  \nIn 2019, the California Legislature approved and the Governor signed Assembly Bill \n(AB) 1482 (known as the Tenant Protection Act of 2019) (hereinafter referred to as the \n\u201cTenant Protection Act\u201d) .146 The Tenant Protection Act caps gross rental increases at \ncovered properties within a 12 -month period at 5% plus the change in the cost of living \npursuant to the Consumer Price Index, or 10%, whichever is lower.147 Landlords are also \nprohibited from increasing rent more than  two times in a 12 -month period.148 \nUnder the law, landlords can still establish the initial rental rate at any amount  they \nchoose. The cap on gross rental increases is only applicable to rental increases after the \ninitial r ental rate has been established,149 the rent cap does not apply to the following types \nof properties:  \n\u2022 Some types of government -subsidized  housing.150 \n\u2022 Housing that is limited by agreement or other restriction to providing affordable  \nhousing for persons and families of very low, low, or moderate income.  \n\u2022 College  dormitories.  \n\u2022 Housing subject to a local rent stabilization law that has more restrictive limits on  \nrent increases.  \n\u2022 Housing that is less than 15 years  old, unless it is a mobile  home . \n\u2022 A duplex in which the owner occupied one of the units as their principal place of  \nresidence at the beginning of your tenancy and the owner still lives  there.  \n\u2022 Single family home or condominium if the owner is not a real estate investment  \ntrust (REIT), a corporation, or an LLC in which at least one member is a \ncorporation, and the own er gave the tenant written notice stating the unit is \nexempt from this law.151 You can find out the members of an LLC through a \nsearch on the California Secretary of State business search website.152 \nThe rent cap applies to all rent increases occurring on or after March 15, 2019. \n36  Tenants, however, are not entitled to a credit for rent overcharges paid between March \n15, 2019 and January 1, 2020. The law expires on January 1, 2030, unless extended.  \nSome California cities have rent stabilization ordinances that limit or prohibit rent \nincreases.153 Each jurisdiction\u2019s ordinance is different. Local rent stabilization ordinances \nthat were enacted before September 1, 2019 will take precedence over the statewide measure, regardless whether the protections offered are stronger or weaker. Local ordinances enacted after that date take precedence over the Tenant Protection Act only \nif they offer stronger protections. To the extent a local ordinance applies, some local \nordinances specify procedures that a landlord must follow before increasing a tenant\u2019s rent. \nSome cities have rent boards that have the power to approve or deny increases in \nrent. Other city ordinances allow a certain percentage increase in rent each year. Under state law, all units are subject to \u201cvacancy decontrol.\u201d This means that the landlord can \nre-rent a unit at the market rate when the tenant moves out voluntarily, abandons the \nunit, or when the landlord evicts a tenant because of a breach of the rental agreement, \nterminates the tenancy for nonpayment of rent or other allowed reasons.  \nA rent stabilization ordinance may impact the landlord- tenant relationship in other \nimportant ways besides those described herein. Find out if you live in a city or county  \nwith rent stabilization or other rental housing laws (see the list of cities and counties \nwith rent stabilization in Appendix 2). Contact your local housing officials or rent stabilization program for information. Most cities and counties post information about their rent stabilization ordinances on their website (for example, information about \nCity of Los Angeles\u2019 rent stabilization ordinance is available at https://hcidla.lacity.org/ ). \nAnother law that places limits on the amount a landlord can increase rent is Penal \nCode section 396. This section covers the 30- day period following a state of \nemergency declared by the President, Governor, or local governing body vested with authority to make that declaration (i.e., City Council, Board of Supervisors, etc.) and prohibits a landlord from increasing rental prices to existing or pros pective tenants by \nmore than 10 percent.\n154 Known as the \u201canti- price gouging\u201d statute, the protections \nset forth in this  statute are intended to prevent sellers of goods or providers of \nservices from charging exorbitant prices for necessities if a state of emergency is declared following a pandemic, wildfire, earthquake or other natural disaster. This rental increase prohibition does not apply if the landlord can prove that an increase of more than 10 percent is directly attributable to additional costs for repairs or additions beyond normal maintenance that were amortized over the rental term that caused the rent to increase by more than 10 percent.  \n \n \nLIVING IN THE RENTAL UNIT  \n \n \nAs a tenant, you must take reasonable care of your rental unit and any common areas \nthat you use. You must also repair all damage, other than normal wear and tear, that you \ncause, or that is caused by anyone for whom you are responsible, such as your family, \nguests, or pets.155\u202fThese important tenant responsibilities are discussed in more detail \n37  under \u201cDealing with Problems,\u201d pages 47- 62. \nThis section discusses other issues that can come up while you\u2019re living in the rental \nunit. For example, can the landlord enter the rental unit without notifying you? Can the \nlandlord raise the rent even if you have a rental agreement? What can you do if you have to move out before the end of the term of your rental agreement?  \nPAYING THE RENT  \nWhen is rent due?  \nMost rental agreements require that rent be paid at the beginning of each rental \nperiod. For example, in a month- to-month tenancy, rent usually must be paid on the first \nday of the month. However, your rental agreement can specify any day of the month as \nthe day that rent is due (for example, the 10th of every month in a month- to-month rental \nagreement, or every Tuesday in a week -to-week rental agreement).  \nAs explained above on page 21, the rental agreement must state the name and \naddress of the person or entity to whom you must make rent payments ( see page 21 ). If \nthis address does not accept personal deliveries, you can mail your rent payment to the owner at the stated name and address. If you can show proof that you mailed the rent to the stated name and address (for example, a receipt for certified mail), the law  \nassumes that the rent was received by the owner on the date of postmark.\n156 \nIt is very important for you to pay your rent on or before the due date. Not paying rent \non time might lead to a negative entry on your credit report.157 late fees (see page 39), or \neven eviction (see pages 90- 104). \nCheck, money order, electronic funds transfer, or cash?  \nThe landlord or landlord\u2019s agent normally cannot require you to pay rent in cash or to \nuse electronic funds transfer. They must allow you to pay by some other means such as \na personal check, a money order or cashier\u2019s check. The manner of payment of your \nrent will usually be specified in your rental agreement. The landlord must also accept \npayment on your behalf by a third party, if that third party provides a legally required \nwritten acknowledgment that the payment gives the third party no rights of tenanc y.158 \nHowever, the landlord or agent can require you to pay rent in cash if, within the last \nthree months, you paid the landlord or agent with a check that was dishonored by the bank. (A dishonored check is one that the bank returns without paying because you \nstopped payment on it or because your account did not contain sufficient funds.)  \nIn order to require you to pay rent in cash, the landlord must first give you a written \nnotice stating that your check was dishonored and that you must pay cash for the period of time stated by the landlord. This period cannot be more than three months after you:  \n\u2022 ordered the bank to stop payment on the check,  or \n\u2022 attempted to pay with a check tha t the bank returned to the landlord because of \ninsufficient funds in your  account.  \nThe landlord must attach a copy of the dishonored check to the notice. If the notice \nchanges the terms of your rental agreement, the landlord must give you the proper \namount of advance notice (see pages 64-68).159 \n38  These same rules apply if the landlord requests you to pay the security deposit in \ncash.  \nExample: Suppose that you have a month -to-month rental agreement and that your \nrent is due on the first of each month. Suppose that the rental agreement does not \nspecify the form of rent payment (check, cash, money order, etc.) or the amount of notice required to change the terms of the agreement (see pages 21- 23). On April \n1, you give your landlord your rent check for April. On April 11, your landlord \nreceives a notice from his or her bank stating that your check was dishonored \nbecause you did not have enough money in your account. On April 12, the landlord hands you a notice stating that your check was dishonored and that you must pay rent in cash or money order for the next three months. What are your rights and obligations under these facts? What are the landlord\u2019s rights and obligations? \nUnfortunately, the law that allows the landlord to require payments in cash or by money order does not clearly answer these questions. The following is based on a \nreasonable interpretation of the law.  \nThe requirement that you pay rent in cash or by money order arguably changes the \nterms of your rental agreement and takes effect in 30 days (on May 12) (see pages 38-39). Therefore, you might argue you could pay your May 1 rent payment by check. \nHowever, this might cause the landlord to return your check and serve a three- day \nnotice to pay or quit or decide to serve you with a 30- day or 60-day notice to end \nthe tenancy (see pages 85-89). It would be better to interpret the maximum 3 - month \nperiod for cash payment or payment by money order to include May\u2019s rent payment. The requirement that you pay rent in cash or by money order continues for a maximum of three months as specified by the landlord after the landlord received the notice that your check was dishonored (through July 10). You very well might have to \npay your June and July rent in cash or by money order, and, if you tried to claim you \nwere not required to do so in May, the August payment as well, if the tenancy continues. It would be prudent to not insist that you do not need to pay in cash or by money order for  May.  \nWhat about your April 1 rent check that was returned by the landlord\u2019s bank? As a \npractical matter, you should make the check good immediately. Otherwise, the landlord \ncan serve you with a three -day notice to pay or quit, which is the first step in the \neviction process (see pages 82- 104).\n160 \nObtaining receipts for rent payments  \nIf you pay rent in cash or with a money order, you should ask your landlord for a \nsigned and dated receipt at the same time that you pay your rent. Legally, you are \nentitled to a written receipt whenever you pay rent.161 If you pay with a check, you can \nuse the canceled check as a receipt. Keep the receipts  or canceled checks forever, so \nthat you have a record of your payments in case of a dispute.  \nLate fees and dishonored check fees  \nWhile there is a legal argument that a rental agreement cannot include a \npredetermined late fee, most rental agreements contain a late fee provision. This is \nbecause there is an exception to this rule when it would be difficult to figure out the actual  cost to the landlord caused by the late rent payment, and the landlord has made \n39  an effort to determine that cost. Even then, the predetermined late fee should not be  \nmore than the reasonable estimate of costs that the landlord will face as a result of the \nlate payment. A late fee that is so high that it amounts to a penalty is not legally \nvalid.162 It is common for rental agreements to provide a \u2018grace period\u2019 before the late \nfee becomes effective. A typical grace period waives the fee if the rent is paid before \nthe 6th. Be sure to read and understand the rental agreement\u2019s late fee provisions.  \nAdditionally, in some communities, late fees are limited by local rent control \nordinances (see \u201cRent Control,\u201d pages 117-118).  \nWhat if you\u2019ve signed a rental agreement that contains a late- fee provision, and you\u2019re \ngoing to be late for the first time paying your rent? If you have a good reason for being \nlate (for example, your paycheck was late), explain this to your landlord. Some landlords \nwill waive (forgive) the late fee if there is a good reason for the rent being late, and if the \ntenant has been responsible in other ways. If the landlord isn\u2019t willing to forgive or lower the late fee, ask the landlord to justify it (for example, in terms of administrative costs for processing the payment late). However, if the late fee is reasonable, it may be valid.  \nThe landlord also can charge the tenant a fee if the tenant\u2019s check for the rent (or any \nother payment) is dishonored by the tenant\u2019s bank. A dishonored check is often called a \u201cbounced\u201d or \u201cNSF\u201d (non -sufficient funds) or \u201creturned\u201d check. In order for the landlord to \ncharge the tenant a returned check fee, the rental agreement must authorize the fee, and the amount of the fee must be reasonable.  \nFor example, a reasonable returned check fee would be the amount that the bank \ncharges the landlord, plus the landlord\u2019s reasonable costs because the check was returned. Under California\u2019s \u201cbad check\u201d statute, the landlord can charge a service charge instead of the dishonored check fee described in this paragraph. The service charge can be up to $25 for the first check that is returned for insufficient funds, and up \nto $35 for each additional check.\n163 \nPartial rent payments  \nYou will violate your rental agreement if you do not pay the full amount of your rent on \ntime. If you cannot pay the full amount on time, you may want to offer to pay part of the \nrent. However, the law allows your landlord to refuse a partial payment or to take the \npartial payment and still give you a three -day notice to pay or quit.164 \nIf your landlord is willing to accept a partial rent payment and give you extra time to \npay the balance, it is important that you and the landlord agree on the details in writing, \nand that you save this writing forever. The written agreement should state the amount of partial rent that you paid, the date by which the rest of the rent must be paid, the amount  \nof any late fee due, and the landlord\u2019s agreement not to take any action to evict you if \nyou pay the amount due by the specified date. Both you and the landlord should sign \nthe agreement, and you should keep a copy forever. An agreement of this kind is legally \nbinding.  \nSECURITY DEPOSIT INCREASES \nWhether the landlord can increase the amount of the security deposit after you move \nin depends on what the rental agreement says, how much of a security deposit you have \npaid already, what the reason for the increase is and whether local law permits such an increase.  \n40  If you have a rental agreement, the security deposit cannot be increased unless \nincreases are permitted by the terms of the rental agreement.  Again, security \ndeposit increases can only reach the amount of one month\u2019s rent.  \nIn a periodic rental agreement (for example, a month -to-month agreement), the \nlandlord can increase the security deposit unless prohibited by the agreement. The \nlandlord must give you proper notice before increasing the security deposit. (For example, 30 days\u2019 advance written notice normally is required in a month -to-month \nrental agreement.). In a fixed -term rental agreement , a change in deposit can \ntypically only occur upon renewal of the agreement, unless the rental agreement \nprovides otherwise.  \nLimits on security deposits may vary for tenants who are active- duty military service \npersonnel (see the discussion of the limits on security deposits, page  81). Local rent \nstabilization ordinances may also limit or prohibit increases in security deposits.  \nThe landlord must give you proper advance written notice of any increase in the \nsecurity deposit (see \u201cProper Service of Notices,\u201d pages 89-90). \nThe landlord normally cannot require you to pay the security deposit increase in cash \nor by electronic funds transfer, without offering other options (see page 38 ). \nRENT INCREASES  \nHow much can rent be raised?  \nIf you are covered by the Tenant Protection Act  (State rent limits ), which applies to a \nsignificant percentage of rental properties, the landlord can only raise rent in a 12-month \nperiod by 5% plus the inflation rate or  10 percent, whichever is lower.\n165 If the rate of \ninflation exceeds 5%, the maximum rent increase will be 10% for  properties covered by \nthe Act.  \n The rent limit does not apply to certain types of properties, as discussed on pages \n67-68 of this guide.   \nHow often can rent be raised?  \nThis depends on whether your rental unit is subject to local or state rent stabilization \nlaws and the terms of your rental agreement.  \nFor rental agreements with a fixed term (i.e., 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, etc.) , the \nlandlord cannot increase the rent during the rental term unless the rental agreement \npermits rent increases. Rent may be increased if the rental agreement is renewed.  \nFor rental agreements with periodic terms (e.g., week -to-week or month -to-month) , properties \nsubject to the Tenant Protection Act require 30 days\u2019 written notice prior to any proposed rent \nincrease. If the property is exempt from the State rent limit and no local rent stabilization \nordinances apply, the landlord must provide the tenant with either 30 days\u2019 notice (if the rent \nincrease is 10 percent or less) or 90 days\u2019 advanced written notice (if the rent increase is more \nthan 10 percent).166 Under these circumstances, there is no limit on how many times the landlord \nmay raise the rent, except for the required advance written notice is required, and increases cannot be retaliatory or discriminatory. The actual number of days of advance notice will depend \non the amount that the landlord increases the rent.  The written notice must t ell you how much the \nrent will increase and when the increase will go into effect. \n41  In order to calculate the percentage of the rent increase, you need to know the lowest rent that \nyour landlord charged you during the preceding 12 months, and the combined total of the new \nincrease and any other increases during that period.  \nExample for when 30 days\u2019 notice required: Assume that your rent has been $3,000 per \nmonth since June of last year. Your landlord wants to increase your rent by  $150, to $3,150, \nbeginning on June 1. Here\u2019s how to calculate the percentage of the rent increase and the amount \nof notice that the landlord must give you:  \n \nThe 30- day notice requirement essentially applies for any rent increase of 10% or \nless, regardless of whether  your rental unit is subject to the State rent limit or is e xempt \nfrom the State rent limit.167 \nExample for when 90 days\u2019 notice required: Assume that you live in a property that \nis exempt from the rent limit of the Tenant Protection Act (e.g.., a rental unit that was \nbuilt within the previous 15 years), so your landlord is allowed to raise your rent by more than 10%. Assume that your rent was $2,500 last June 1, and that your landlord raised your rent by $250, to $2,750, last November. Your landlord wants to increase your rent \nagain by $250 on June 1 to $3,000 per month. Here\u2019s how to calculate the percentage of \nthe rent increase and the amount of notice that the landlord must give you: \n \n \n     A landlord must give proper advance written notice of the increase in rent, and the \nincrease cannot be retaliatory (see pages 102 -104). If the rental unit is subject to a local \nrent stabilization ordinance instead of the Tenant Protection Act, the local ordinance may impose stricter rent limits and additional requirements on the landlord.  First, calculate the percentage increase in the rent by dividing the amount of \nthe proposed increase by the lowest rent charged in the past 12 months. It is:  \n  150  \n3000 =  5% \nThe current  rent increase  ($150)  does  not exceed  10 percent  of the lowest  rent \ncharged in the past 12 months ($3,000). Therefore, your landlord must give you at \nleast 30 days\u2019 advance written notice of the rent  increase.  \nThe percentage increase in the rent must be calculated by adding all the rental \nincreases made in the 12 months previous to the effective date of the increase, June  \n1. The combined rent increase is:  \n$ 250 \n+   250 \n$ 500 \nThe percentage of increase is calculated using the lowest rent charged during \nthe preceding 12 months. The lowest rent charged was $2,500. The percentage of \nincrease equals:  \n500 \n2500 = 20%  \nSince the increase is greater than 10%, the landlord must give you at least 90 \ndays\u2019 notice.  \n42  Increases in rent for government -subsidized housing usually are restricted. If a tenant \nlives in government -subsidized housing, the tenant should check with the local public \nhousing authority, housing counseling agency, legal aid organization, tenant -landlord \nprogram, or housing clinic to find out whether there are any restrictions on rent \nincreases.   \nRent increase; notice and effective date  \nA landlord\u2019s notice of rent increase must be in writing. The landlord can deliver a copy \nof the notice to you personally.168 In this case, the rent increase takes effect in 30 or 90 \ndays, as just explained.  \nThe landlord also can send you a notice of rent increase by first class mail. In this \ncase, the landlord must mail a copy of the notice to you, with proper postage, addressed to you at the rental unit. The landlord must give you an additional five days\u2019 advance notice of the rent increase if the landlord mails the notice and the place of mailing is within California. The period of notice may be longer if notice is mailed from outside of California (10 days), or from outside of the United States (20 days). Therefore, if notice \nis mailed from within California, the landlord would have to give you at least 35 days\u2019 \nnotice from the date of mailing if the rent increase is 10 percent or less. If the rent increase is greater  than 10 percent,  the landlord would  have to give you at least  95 days\u2019 \nnotice from the date of mailing.\n169 \nExample of a rent increase \nMost notices of rent increases state that the increase will go into effect at the \nbeginning of the next rental period. For example, a landlord who wishes to increase the rent by 5 percent in a month- to-month rental effective on October 1 must make sure tha t \nnotice of the increase is delivered to the tenant personally by September 1 or mailed to \nthe tenant by August 27. However, a landlord can make the increase effective at any \ntime in the month if proper advance notice is given.  \nIf the increase in the rent becomes effective in the middle of the rental period, the \nlandlord is entitled to receive the increased rent for only the last half of the rental period. For example:  \n\u2022 Rental per iod: month -to-month, from the first day of the month to the last day of the \nmonth.  \n\u2022 Rent: $2,500 per  month.  \n\u2022 Rent increase: $125 (from $2,500 to $2,625) per month (a 5 percent  increase).  \n\u2022 Date that the notice of rent increa se is delivered to the tenant personally: March 17 \n(that is, the middle of the  month).  \n\u2022 Earliest date that the rent increase can take effect: April  16. \nIf the landlord delivers the notice on March 17, the increase becomes effective 30 \ndays later, on April 16. The landlord is entitled to the increased rent beginning on April  \n16. On April 1, the tenant would pay $1,250 for the first half of April (that is, 15 days at the old rent of $2,500, from April 1 to 15), plus $1,312.50 for the last half of April (that is, 15 days at the new rent of $2,625, from April 16 -30). The total rent for April that is due \non April 1 would be $2,562.50. Looking at it another way, the landlord is entitled to only \none-half of the increase in the rent during April, since the notice of rent increase became  \n43  effective in the middle of the month.  \nOf course, the landlord could deliver a notice of rent increase on March 17 which \nstates that the rent increase takes effect on May 1. In that case, the tenant would pay  \n$2,500 rent on April 1, and $2,625 rent on May 1.  \nWHEN CAN THE LANDLORD ENTER THE RENTAL UNIT?  \nCalifornia law states that a landlord can enter a rental unit only for certain specified \nreasons. The landlord does not have the right to enter to conduct a general inspection. \nOnly the following reasons for entry are permitted:  \n\u2022 In an  emergency.  \n\u2022 When the tenant has surrendered or abandoned the rental  unit. \n\u2022 To make necessary or agreed- upon repairs, decorations, alte rations, or other \nimprovements or supply necessary or agreed -upon services.  \n\u2022 To show the rental unit to prospective tenants, purchasers, or lenders, to provide \nentry to contractors or workers who are to perform work on the unit, or to conduct an \ninitial inspection requested by the tenant before the end of the tenancy (see Initial \nInspection sidebar, pages 71-73). \n\u2022 If a court order permits the landlord to  enter.170 \n\u2022 To install, repair, replace, maintain, or read  the submetering of water service.171 \n\u2022 To inspect elevated balconies or  decks.172 \n\u2022 To inspect an area where the resident is engaging in personal  agriculture.173 \n\u2022 To repair, test and/or maintain smoke detectors or carbon monoxide detectors.174 \n\u2022 If the tenant has a waterbed, to inspect the installation of the waterbed when the \ninstallation has been completed, and periodically  after that to assure that the \ninstallation meets the requirements of the law.175 \nThe landlord or the landlord\u2019s agent must give the tenant reasonable advance notice \nin writing before entering the unit and can enter only during normal business hours \n(generally, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days per week). The notice must state the date, approximate  time, and purpose of the entry.\n176 However , advance written notice is not \nrequired under any of the following circumstances: \n\u2022 To respond to an emergency.  \n\u2022 The tenant moved out or abandoned the rental  unit. \n\u2022 The tenant is present and consents to the entry at the time of  entry. \n\u2022 The tenant and landlord agreed that the landlord will make repairs or supply \nservices, and agreed orally that the landlord may enter to make the repairs or supply \nthe services. The agreement must include the date and appr oximate time of entry, \nwhich must be within one week of the oral agreement.177 \nThe landlord or agent may use any one of the following methods to give the tenant \nwritten notice of intent to enter the unit:  \n\u2022 Personally deliver the notice to the tenant;  or \n44  \u2022 Leave the notice at the rental unit with a person of suitable age and discretion (for \nexample, a roommate or a teenage member of the tenant\u2019s household);  or \n\u2022 Leave the notice on, near, or under the unit\u2019s usual entry door in such a way that it is \nlikely to be found;  or \n\u2022 Mail the notice to the tenant.178 \nAbsent evidence to the contrary, the law considers 24 hours\u2019 advance written notice to \nbe reasonable in most situations.  \nIf the notice is mailed to the tenant, mailing at least six days before the intended entry \nis presumed to be  reasonable, in most situations.179 The tenant can consent to shorter \nnotice and to entry at times other than during normal business hours.  \nSpecial rules apply if the purpose of the entry is to show the rental to a purchaser. In \nthat case, the landlord or the landlord\u2019s agent may give the tenant notice orally, either in \nperson or by telephone. Absence evidence to the contrary, the law considers 24 hours\u2019 notice to be reasonable in most situations. However, before oral notice can be given, the \nlandlord or agent must first notify the tenant in writing that the rental is for sale and that \nthe landlord or agent may contact the tenant orally to arrange to show the rental. This written notice must be given to the tenant within 120 days of the oral notice. The oral notice must state the date, approximate time and purpose of entry.\n180 The landlord or \nagent may enter only during normal business hours (typically between 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days per week), unless the tenant consents to entry at a different time.\n181 When \nthe landlord or agent enters the rental pursuant to oral notice, they must leave written evidence of  entry, such as a business card.\n182 \nThe landlord cannot abuse the right of access allowed by these rules or  use this right  of \naccess to harass (repeatedly disturb) the tenant.183 Also, the law prohibits a landlord from \nsignificantly and intentionally violating these access rules in an attempt to influence the \ntenant to move out.184 \nIf your landlord violates these access rules, talk to the landlord about your concerns. If \nthat is not successful in stopping the landlord\u2019s misconduct, send the landlord a formal \nletter asking the landlord to strictly observe the access rules stated above, and retain a \ncopy of the letter for your records. If the landlord continues to violate these rules, you \ncan talk to an attorney or a legal aid organization, or file suit in small claims court to recover the damages that you suffered due to the landlord\u2019s  misconduct. If the landlord\u2019s \nviolation of these rules was significant and intentional, and the landlord\u2019s purpose was to influence you to move from the rental unit, you can sue the landlord in small claims  court \nfor a civil penalty of up to $2,000 for each violation.\n185 \nSUBLEASES AND ASSIGNMENTS  \nSometimes, a tenant with a rental agreement may need to move out before the term \nends or  may need help paying the rent. In these situations, the tenant may want to \nsublease the rental unit or assign the rental agreement to another tenant. The tenant may sublease the rental unit or assign the rental agreement unless the terms of the \nrental agreement precludes the tenant from doing so without the prior consent of the landlord.  \n \n45  Subleases \nA sublease is a separate rental agreement between the original tenant and a new \ntenant who moves in temporarily (for example, for the summer), or who moves in with \nthe original tenant and shares the rent. The new tenant is called a subtenant . \nWith a sublease, the agreement between the original tenant and the landlord remains \nin full force and effect. The original tenant is still responsible for paying the rent to the landlord, and functions as a landlord to the subtenant. Any sublease agreement  between \na tenant and a subtenant should be in writing to avoid disputes.  \nMany rental agreements contain a provision that prohibits (prevents) tenants from \nsubleasing or assigning rental units. This kind of provision allows the landlord to control \nwho rents the rental unit. If your rental agreement prohibits subleases or assignm ents, \nyou must get your landlord\u2019s permission before you sublease or assign the rental unit.  \nEven if your rental agreement does not contain a provision prohibiting you from \nsubleasing or assigning, it is wise to discuss your plans with your landlord in advance. \nSubleases and assignments usually do not work out smoothly unless everyone has \nagreed in advance in writing. A lease provision requiring the landlord\u2019s consent to assign or sublease, but providing no standard for giving or withholding consent, is construed to contain an implied standard that such consent will not be unreasonably withheld.\n186  \nYou might use a sublease in two situations. In the first situation, you may have a \nlarger apartment or house than you need and  may want help paying the rent. Therefore, \nyou want to rent a room to someone. In the second situation, you may want to leave the rental unit for a certain period and return to it later. For example, you may be a college student who leaves the campus area for the summer and returns in the fall. You may want to sublease to a subtenant who will agree to use the rental unit only for a particular period of time.  \nUnder a sublease agreement, the subtenant agrees to make payments to you, not to \nthe landlord. The subtenant has no direct responsibility to the landlord, only to you.  \nGenerally, the subtenant should not be given any greater rights than you do as the original tenant. To do so might create a conflict with your terms and obligations under \nyour rental agreement. For example, if you have a month- to-month rental agreement, \nyou should not promise the subtenant a fixed -term. If your rental agreement does not \nallow you to have a pet, then the subtenant cannot have a pet, as it creates a violation of your agreement with the landlord.  \nIn any sublease situation, it is essential that both you and the subtenant have a clear \nunderstanding of your obligations. To help avoid disputes between you and the subtenant, this understanding should be put in the form of a written sublease agreement \nthat both you and the subtenant sign.  \nThe sublease agreement should cover things like the amount and due date of the \nrent, where the subtenant is to send the rent, who is responsible for paying the utilities \n(typically, gas, electric, water, trash, and telephone), the dates the agreement begins and ends, a list of any possessions that you are leaving in the rental unit, and any \nconditions of care and use of the rental unit and your possessions. It is also important \nthat the sublease agreement be consistent with the rental agreement, so that you r \nobligations under the rental agreement are fully performed by the subtenant (assuming \n46  that is what you and the subtenant have agreed upon).  \nAssignments  \nAn assignment is a transfer of your rights as a tenant to someone else. You might \nuse an assignment if you have a rental agreement for one year and need to move \npermanently before the term ends. Like a sublease, an assignment is a contract \nbetween the original tenant and the new tenant (not the landlord).  \nHowever, an assignment differs from a sublease in one important way. If the new \ntenant accepts the assignment, the new tenant is directly responsible to the landlord for the payment of rent, for damage to the rental unit, and so on. Nevertheless, an assignment does not relieve the original tenant of his or her legal obligations to the \nlandlord unless the landlord explicitly releases the original tenant from his/her obligations. If the new tenant does not pay rent, or damages the rental unit, the original tenant (unless released from his/her obligations by the landlord) remains legally \nresponsible to the landlord.\n187 \nIn order for the original tenant to be relieved of his/her obligations under the original  rental \nagreement, the landlord, the original tenant, and the new tenant all must agree that the new \ntenant will be solely responsible to the landlord under the assignment. This agreement is called a \nnovation , and must be in writing.  \nShort Term Rentals  \nIt is important to understand that most rent agreements also prohibit you from using \nyour unit as a short -term rental, such as renting the unit through websites like AirBnB \nand VRBO. Many local laws also prohibit rental units from being rented in this way and \ncarry with them heavy fines for violating the law.  \nRemember: Even if the landlord agrees to a sublease or assignment, the original \ntenant is still responsible for the rental unit unless there is a written agreement (a \nnovation) that states otherwise. For this reason, think very carefully about who you consider subleasing or assigning your rental unit to.  \n \n \nDEALING WITH PROBLEMS  \n \n \nAll tenants have a right to a safe rental unit. Most landlord- tenant relationships go \nsmoothly. However, problems sometimes do arise. For example, what if the rental unit\u2019s \nfurnace goes out in the middle of the winter? What happens if the landlord sells the building or decides to convert it into condominiums? This section discusses these and other possible issues and problems that may arise in the landlord-tenant relationship.  \nREPAIRS AND HABITABILITY  \nA rental unit must be fit to live in; that is, it must be habitable. In legal terms, \n\u201chabitable\u201d means that the rental unit is fit for occupation by human beings and that it \nsubstantially complies with state and local building and health codes that materially \naffect tenants\u2019 health and safety.\n188 \nCalifornia law makes landlords and tenants each responsible for certain kinds of \nrepairs, although landlords ultimately are legally responsible for ensuring that their rental \n47  units are habitable.  \nLandlord\u2019s responsibility for repairs  \nBefore renting a rental unit to a tenant, a landlord must make the unit fit to live in, or \nhabitable. Additionally, while the unit is being rented, the landlord must repair problems \nthat make the rental unit unfit to live in, or uninhabitable. \nThe landlord has this duty to repair because of a California Supreme Court case, \ncalled Green v. Superior Court ,189 which held that all residential leases and rental \nagreements contain an implied warranty of habitability . Under the \u201cimplied warranty of \nhabitability,\u201d the landlord is legally responsible for repairing conditions that seriously  \naffect the rental unit\u2019s habitabi lity.190 That is, the landlord must repair substantial defects \nin the rental unit  and substantial failures to comply with state and local building and \nhealth codes.191 However, the landlord is not responsible under the implied warranty of \nhabitability for repai ring damages that were caused by the tenant or the t enant\u2019s family, \nguests, or pets.192 \nGenerally, the landlord also must complete maintenance work which is necessary to \nkeep the rental unit livable.193 Whether the landlord or the tenant is responsible for \nmaking less serious repairs is usually determined by the rental agreement.  \nThe law is very specific as to what kinds of conditions make a rental unit \nuninhabitable. If you believe that your landlord is providing you with an uninhabitable home, it is best to document those conditions with photographs or written repair requests with descriptions and date of the problem and how long that condition has been \noccurring. These are discussed in the following pages.  \nTenant\u2019s responsibility for repairs  \nTenants are required by law to take reasonable care of their rental units, as well as \ncommon areas such as hallways and outside areas. Tenants must act to keep those areas clean and undamaged. Tenants also are responsible to repair all damage that results from their neglect or abuse, and to repair damage caused by anyone for whom \nthey are responsible, such as family, guests, or pets.\n194\u202fTenants\u2019 responsibilities for care \nand repair of the rental unit are discussed in detail on pages 74-76. \nConditions that make a rental unit legally uninhabitable  \nThere are many kinds of defects that could make a rental unit unlivable. The implied \nwarranty of habitability, which applies to every single residential tenancy in California, \nrequires landlords t o maintain their rental units in a condition fit for the \u201coccupation of \nhuman beings.\u201d195 In addition, the rental unit must \u201csubstantially comply\u201d with building \nand housing code standards that materially affect tenants\u2019 health and safety.196 \nA rental unit may be considered uninhabitable (unlivable) I f it contains a lead hazard \nthat endangers the occupants or the public, or is a substandard building because of, for \nexample, a structural hazard, inadequate sanitation, or a nuisance that endangers the \nhealth, life, safety, property, or welfare of the occupants or the public.197 \nA dwelling also may be considered uninhabitable (unlivable) if it substantia lly lacks \nany of the following:198\u202f \n\u2022 Effective waterproofing and weather pro tection of roof and exterior walls,  \nincluding unbroken windows and doors.  \n48  \u2022 Plumbing facilities in good working order,  including hot and cold running water, \nconnected to a sewage disposal  system.  \n\u2022 Gas facilities in good working order. \n\u2022 Heating facilities in good working order. \n\u2022 An electric system, including lighting, wiring, and equipment, in good working order. \n\u2022 Clean and sanitary buildings, grounds, and appurtenances (for example, a garden or \na detached garage), free from debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents, and vermin at \nthe inception of the tenancy and areas within the landlord\u2019s control during the \ntenancy.  \n\u2022 Adequate trash receptacles in good  repair. \n\u2022 Floors, stairways, and railings in good repair. \nIn addition to these requirements, each rental unit must have all of the following:  \n\u2022 A working toilet, wash basin, and bathtub or shower. The toilet and  bathtub or \nshower must be in a room which is ventilated and allows  privacy.  \n\u2022 Natural lighting in every room through windows or skylights. Windows in each room \nmust be able to open at least halfway for ventilation, unless a fan provides \nmechanical  ventilation.  \n\u2022 Safe fire or emergency exits leading to a street or hallway. Stairs, hallways, and exits \nmust be kept litter -free. S torage areas, garages, and basements must be kept free  of \ncombustible material s.199 \n\u2022 Operable dead bolt locks on the main en try doors of rental units, and operable \nlocking  or security devices on windows.200 \n\u2022 Working smoke detectors that meet applicable code requirements in all bedrooms \nand other designated areas of rental units, except for manufactured housing, such as a mobilehome. Apar tment complexes also must have smoke detectors in \ncommon stairwells.\n201 Also, any rental unit that includes appliances (water heater, \nheater,  stove,  fireplace,  etc.) that utilize  \u2018fossil fuels\u2019  (natural  gas, propane,  fuel oil, \netc.), or which has an attached garage, are required to have wo rking carbon \nmonoxide detectors that meet applicable code requirements.202 \n\u2022 A locking mailbox  for each unit. The mailbox  must be consistent with the United \nStates Postal Service standards for apartment housing mail  boxes.203 \n\u2022 Ground fault circuit interrupters for swimming pools and anti -suction protections for \nwading pools in apart ment complexes and other residential settings (but not single -\nfamily  residences).204 \nThe implied warranty of habitability is not violated merely because the rental unit is \nnot in perfect, aesthetically pleasing condition. Nor is the implied warranty of habitability \nviolated if there are minor housing code violations, which, standing alone, do not affect \nhabitability.205 \nWhile it is the landlord\u2019s responsibility to install and maintain the inside wiring for one \ntelephone jack, it is unclear whether the landlord\u2019s failure to do so is a breach of the \nimplied warranty of habitability.206\u202f \nThere are two additional ways in which the implied warranty of habitability may be \nviolated. The first is the presence of mold conditions in the rental unit that the landlord \n49  has notice of and affect the livability of the unit or the health and safety of tenants. The \ntenant should notify his/her landlord if he/she is aware of water intrusion or suspects the \npresence of mold. Since January 1, 2016, visible mold growth, as determined by a health officer or a code enforcement officer, that is judged to be other than superficial, such as mildew,  may be a substandard condition.\n207 The second follows from a law that \nimposes obligations on a property owner who is notified by a local health officer that the property is contaminated by methamphetamine (see page 30 ). A tenant who is \ndamaged by this kind of documented contamination may be able to claim a breach of the implied warranty of habitability.\n208 \nLimitations on landlord\u2019s duty to keep the rental unit habitable  \nEven if a rental unit is unlivable because of one of the conditions listed above, a \nlandlord may not be legally required to repair the condition if the tenant has not fulfilled the tenant\u2019s own responsibilities.  \nIn addition to generally requiring a tenant to take reasonable care of the rental unit \nand common areas ( see page 48), the law lists specific things that a tenant must do to \nkeep the rental unit livable.  \n \nTenants must do all of the following:  \n\u2022 Keep the premises \u201cas clean and sanitary as the condition of the premises  \npermits.\u201d  \n\u2022 Use and operate gas, electrical, and plumbing fixtures properly. (Examples of \nimproper use include overloading electrical outlets; flushing large, foreign objects \ndown the toilet; or allowing any gas, electrical, or plumbing fixture to become filthy.) \n\u2022 Dispose of trash and garbage in a clean and sanitary manner. However , a landlord \nmay agree in writing to clean the rental unit and dispose of the trash.209 \n\u2022 Not destroy, damage, or deface the premises, or allow anyone else to do so. \n\u2022 Not remove any part of the structure, dwelling uni t, facilities, equipment, or \nappurtenances, or allow anyone else to do so. \n\u2022 Use the premises as a place to live and use the rooms for their intended purposes. \nFor example, the bedroom must be used as a bedroom, and not as a kitchen.210 \n\u2022 Notify the landlord when dead bolt locks and window locks or security devices do not \noperate properly,211 and notify the landlord or manager if the tenant becomes aware \nof an inoperable smoke or carbon monoxide detection systems.212 \nHowev er, a landlord may agree in writing to clean the rental unit and dispose of the \ntrash.213 \nEven if a tenant violates these requirements, in some minor way, the landlord is still \nresponsible for providing a habitable dwelling and may be prosecuted for violating \nhousing code standards. If the tenant fails to do one of these required things, and the tenant\u2019s failure has either substantially caused an unlivable condition to occur or has substantially interfered with the landl ord\u2019s ability to repair the condition, the landlord does \nnot have to repair the condition\n214 and the tenant cannot withhold rent, until the tenant \ncures his/her own violation.215 \n \n50  Responsibility for other kinds of repairs  \nAs for less serious repairs, the rental agreement may require either the tenant or the \nlandlord to fix a particular item. Items covered by such an agreement might include \nrefrigerators, washing machines, parking places, or swimming pools. These items are \nusually considered \u201camenities,\u201d and their absence does not make a dwelling unit unfit for \nliving.  \nThese agreements to repair are usual ly enforceable in accordance with the intent of \nthe parties to the rental agreement.216 \nHowever, a tenant may have a right to a reduced rent if a landlord does not provide \ncertain amenities that are part of the tenant\u2019s lease. A local rent control ordinance may \nallow a tenant to file a petition seeking a reduced rent until the amenities are r estored. \nTenant\u2019s agreement to make repairs  \nThe landlord and the tenant may agree in the rental agreement that the tenant will \nperform some of the repairs and maintenance in exchange for lower rent.217\u202f Regardless \nof any such agreement, the landlord is responsible for maintaining the property as \nrequired by state and local housing codes.218 Such an agreement must be made in \ngood faith, namely there must be a real reduction in the rent, and the tenant must intend \nand be able to make all the necessary repairs. When negotiating the agreement, the \ntenant should consider they want to try to negotiate a cap on the amount that they can \nbe required to spend making repairs. To be clear, a tenant being responsible for any \nhabitability -related repairs will be a result of the tenant\u2019s agreement. A landlord cannot \nunilaterally change the terms of a tenancy to shift the responsibility for these repairs \nafter the tenant\u2019s initial occupancy. \nRegardless of any such agreement, the landlord is ultimately responsibl e for \nmaintaining the property as required by state and local housing codes.219 \nHAVING REPAIRS MADE  \nIf a tenant believes that his or her rental unit needs repairs and the landlord is \nresponsible for the repairs under the implied warranty of habitability, the tenant should \nnotify the landlord in writing and retain a copy for their records. Since rental units \ntypically are business investments for landlords, most landlords want to keep them safe, \nclean, attractive, and in good repair.  \nIf the damage or repairs require urgent attention, the tenant should notify the landlord \norally (i.e., telephone or in person) and memorialize his/her communication in writing immediately thereafter. The tenant should specifically describe the damage or defects \nand the required repairs. The tenant should date the writing and always keep a copy of it \nto show that notice was given, and what it said (see pages 47 -60). \nIf the tenant sends a letter to the landlord, manager, or agent, the tenant\n220 should try \nto send it by certified mail with return receipt requested. Sending the notice by certified mail is not required by law but is a very good idea. In the alternative , the tenant (or a \nfriend) may personally deliver the notice to the landlord, manager, or agent and ask for a receipt to show that the notice was received. The tenant should always keep a copy of \nthe notice and the receipt, or some other evidence that the notice was delivered (see \n\u201cGiving the landlord notice,\u201d pages 57 -58). \nA landlord, owner or manager may enter  the rental unit to make necessary or agreed \n51  upon repairs, but they must provide the tenant with a written Notice of Intent to Enter.  \nThe landlord must provide the Notice of Intent to Enter  at least 24 -hours in advance \nof entry.  \nA landlord is also responsible for changing the locks if the tenant is a survivor of \ndomestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking and provides the landlord with a copy of \neither a valid restraining order (that includes a move- out order if the abuser lives with the \nsurvivor) or a police report involving domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking \nagainst the tenant that occurred within 180 days. The landlord must change the locks \nwithin 24 hours of notice of the tenant\u2019s request. If the landlord fails to do so within 24 hours of receiving notice from the tenant, the tenant may have the locks changed, even if the lease prohibits them from otherwise doing so. The tenant must change the lock to a similar likeness and quality to the original lock, provide the landlord with notice of the locks change and provide the landlord with the new key. The tenant can notify the \nlandlord that the tenant made this required change themselves, and deduct the cost of \nchanging the locks from their next rental payment in the same manner as described in the \u201crepair and deduct remedy \u201d section discussed on page 52.\n221 If the landlord does not \nmake the requested repairs, and does not have a good reason for not doing so, the tenant may have several remedies, depending on the seriousness of the repairs. These \nremedies are discussed below. Each of these remedies has its own risks and \nrequirements, so the tenant should use them  carefully . \nRegardless of which remedy a tenant uses, it is always a good idea to document \ndefective conditions with photographs or video.  \nThe \u201crepair and deduct\u201d remedy  \nThe \u201c repair and deduct \u201d remedy allows a tenant to deduct money from the rent to \npay for repair of defects in the rental unit if the repairs would not cost more than one \nmonth\u2019s rent.\n222\u202fThis remedy covers substandard conditions that affect the tenant\u2019s \nhealth and safety and substantially breach the implied warranty of habitability (see discussion of the implied warranty of habitability , pages 47-51).\n223 Examples might \ninclude a leak in the roof during the rainy season, no hot running water, or a gas leak.  \nAs a practical matter, the repair and deduct remedy allows a tenant to make needed \nrepairs of serious conditions without filing a lawsuit against the landlord. Because this \nremedy involves legal technicalities, it is recommended that the tenant talk to a l awyer, \nlegal aid organization, or tenants\u2019 association before proceeding.  \nThe basic requirements and steps for using the repair and deduct remedy are as \nfollows:  \n1. The defects must be serious and directly related to the tenant\u2019s health and safety.224\u202f \n2. The repairs cannot cost more than one month\u2019s  rent. \n3. The tenant cannot use the repair and deduct remedy more than twice in any 12- month  \nperiod.  \n4. The tenant or the tenant\u2019s family, guests, or pets must not have caused the defects \nthat require repair.  \n5. The tenant must inform the landlord, either orally or in writing, of the repairs that are \nneeded (see \u201cGiving the landlord notice,\u201d pages 57-58). Writing is strongly \n52  recommended. If you notify the landlord via writing, retain a copy of the notice for \nyour records.  \n6. The tenant must give the landlord a reasonable period of time to make the needed \nrepairs before undertaking the repairs  themselves.  \n\u2022 What is a reasonable period of time? This depends on the defects and the types \nof repairs that are needed. The law usually considers 30 days to be reasonable, \nbut a shorter period may be considered reasonable, depending on the  situation.  \nFor example, if the furnace is broken and it is very cold outdoors, one to two days \nmay be considered reasonable (assuming that a qualified repair person is available within that time period).  \n7. If the landlord does not make the repairs within a reasonable period of time, the \ntenant may either make the repairs or hire someone to do them. The tenant may then deduct the cost of the repairs from the rent when it is due. The tenant should keep all rec eipts for the  repairs.  \n\u2022 It is recommended, but not required by law, that the tenant give the landlord a \nwritten notice that explains why the tenant has not paid the full amount of the rent. The tenant should always keep a copy of this  notice.  \nRisks: The defects may not be serious enough to justify using the repair and deduct \nremedy. In that event, the landlord can sue the tenant to recover the money deducted \nfrom the rent or  can serve a 3 -day notice to pay rent or quit and file an eviction action \nbased on the tenant\u2019s nonpayment of rent. If the tenant deducted money for repairs not covered by the remedy, or did not give the landlord proper advance notice or a reasonable period of time to make repairs, the court can order the tenant to pay the full rent even though the tenant paid for the repairs, or can order that the eviction proceed. \nBecause of the risk of a lawsuit, tenants who plan to use the repair and deduct remedy \nshould document the defective conditions with photographs or video and keep copies of letters informing the landlord of the problem. Before the tenant repairs and deducts, it is a good idea to check with a legal aid organization, lawyer, housing clinic, or tenant program to help determine if rent withholding is the appropriate remedy.  \nThe landlord may try to terminate the tenancy, increase the rent, decrease services or \nfile a legal action to evict the tenant because the tenant used the repair and deduct remedy. These actions are known as \u201c retaliatory acts\u201d ( see pages 102 -104). The law \nprohibits retaliation, but the landlord may still attempt to do so. A tenant should contact a legal aid organization, lawyer, housing clinic, or tenant program, if they believe they are being subject to retaliation.\n225 \nThe \u201cabandonment\u201d remedy  \nInstead of using the repair and deduct remedy, a tenant can abandon (move out of) a \nseriously defective rental unit. This remedy is called the \u201cabandonment\u201d remedy. A \ntenant might use the aba ndonment remedy where the defects would cost more than one \nmonth\u2019s rent to repair,226 but this is not a requirement of the remedy . The abandonment \nremedy has most of the same requirements and basic steps as the repair and deduct remedy.\n227 \nIn order to use the abandonment remedy, the rental unit must have substandard \nconditions that affect the tenant\u2019s health and safety and substantially breach the implied \n53  warranty of habitability (see discussion of the implied warranty of habitability, pages 47-\n51).228 If the tenant uses this remedy properly, the tenant  is not responsible for paying \nfurther rent once the y have  abandoned the rental unit.229 \nThe basic requirements and steps for lawfully abandoning a rental unit are:  \n1. The defects must be serious and directly related to the tenant\u2019s health and safety.230\u202f \n2. The tenant or the tenant\u2019s family, guests, or pets must not have caused the defects \nthat require repair.  \n3. The tenant must inform the landlord, either orally or in writing, of the repairs that are \nneeded (see \u201cGiving the landlord notice,\u201d pages 57-58). Writing is strongly \nrecommended. If you notify your landlord in writing, always retain a copy for  yourself.  \n4. The tenant must give the landlord a reasonable period of time to make the needed \nrepairs.  \n\u2022 What is a reasonable period of time? This depends on the defects and the types \nof repairs that are needed. The law usually considers 30 days to be reasonable, but a shorter period may be considered reasonable, depending on the \ncircumstances. For example, if tree roots block the main sewer drain and none of the toilets or drains work, a reasonable period might be as little as one or two days.  \n \n5. If the landlord does not make the repairs within a reasonable period of time, the \ntenant should notify the landlord in writing of the tenant\u2019s reasons for moving and \nthen actually move out. The tenant should return all the rental unit\u2019s keys to the \nlandlor d. The notice should be mailed or delivered as explained in \u201cGiving the \nlandlord notice,\u201d pages 57-58. The tenant should always keep a copy of the notice.  \n\u2022 It is recommended, but not required by law, that the tenant give the landlord \nwritten notice of the tenant\u2019s reasons for moving out. The tenant\u2019s letter  may \ndiscourage the landlord from suing the tenant to collect additional rent or other damages. A written notice also documents the tenant\u2019s reasons for moving, which may be helpful in the event of a later lawsuit. If possible, the tenant should \ntake photographs or a video of the defective conditions or have local health or \nbuilding officials inspect the rental unit before moving out. If you end up in court, a report from a local health or building official documenting the existence of substantial substandard conditions will be helpful. The tenant should keep a copy of the written notice and any inspection reports and photographs or  videos.  \nRisks: The defects may not affect the tenant\u2019s health and safety seriously enough to \njustify using the remedy. The landlord may sue the tenant to collect additional rent or \ndamages. Again, because of the risk of a lawsuit, tenants who plan to use the \nabandonment remedy should document the defective conditions with photographs or \nvideo and keep copies of letters informing the landlord of the problem. Before the tenant abandons the rental property, it is a good idea to check with a legal aid organization, lawyer, housing clinic, or tenant program to help determine if rent withholding is the appropriate remedy.  \n \n54  The \u201crent withholding\u201d remedy  \nA tenant may have another option for getting repairs made\u2014 the \u201crent withholding \u201d \nremedy.  \nBy law, a tenant is allowed to withhold (stop paying) some or all of the rent if the \nlandlord does not fix serious defects that violate the implied warranty of habitability (see \ndiscussion of the implied warrant y of habitability, pages 47- 51).231 The defects must be \nsubstantial \u2014they must be serious ones that threaten the tenant\u2019s health or safety.232 \nBy way of example, the court in Green v. S uperior Court found the following defects \nserious enough to justify withholding rent:233 \n\u2022 Collapse and non- repair of the bathroom ceiling.  \n\u2022 Continued presence of rats, mice, and  cockroaches.  \n\u2022 Lack of any heat in four of the apartment\u2019s  rooms.  \n\u2022 Plumbing blockages.  \n\u2022 Exposed and faulty  wiring.  \n\u2022 An illegally installed and dangerous  stove. \nIn the Green  case, all of these defects were present, and there also were many \nviolations of the local housing and building codes. In other situations, the defects that \nwould justify rent withholding may be different, but the defects would still have to be serious ones that threaten the tenant\u2019s health or safety.  \nIn order to prove a violation of the implied warranty of habitability, the tenant will \nneed evidence of the defects that require repair. In the event of a court action, it is helpful to have photographs or video of the defects that require repairs, witnesses, and copies of letters informing the landlord of the problem. As with the abandonment remedy, a report from a local health or building official documenting the existence of substantial substandard conditions is helpful in defending the use of this remedy. \nBefore the tenant withholds rent, it is a good idea to check with a legal aid \norganization, lawyer, housing clinic, or tenant program to help determine if rent withholding \nis the appropriate remedy.  \nThe basic requirements and steps for using the rent withholding remedy are:  \n1. The defects or the repairs that are needed must threaten the tenant\u2019s health or \nsafety.\n234 \n\u2022 The defects must be serious enough to make the rental unit uninhabitable. For \nexample, see the defects described in the discussion of the Green case above.  \n2. The tenant, or the tenant\u2019s family, guests, or pets must not have caused the defects \nthat require repair.  \n3. The tenant must inform the landlord either orally or in writing of the repairs that are \nneeded (see \u201cGiving the landlord notice,\u201d pages 57-58). Writing is strongly \nrecommended. If you notify the landlord in writing, always keep a copy for  yourself.  \n4. The tenant must give the landlord a reasonable period of time to make the  repairs.  \n\u2022 What is a reasonable period of time? This depends on the defects and the type \n55  of repairs that are needed. The law usually considers 30 days to be reasonable, \nbut a shorter period may be considered reasonable, depending on  the \ncircumstances (see discussion above).  \n5. If the landlord does not make the repairs within a reasonable period of time, the \ntenant can withhold some or all of the rent. The tenant can continue to withhold the \nrent until the landlord makes the  repairs.  \n\u2022 How much rent can the tenant withhold? While the law does not provide a clear \ntest for determining how much rent is reasonable for the tenant to withhold, \njudges in rent withholding cases often use one of the following methods.  These \nmethods are offered as examples.  \nPercentage reduction in rent: The percentage  of the rental unit that is \nuninhabitable is determined, and the rent is reduced by that amount. For \nexample, if one of a rental unit\u2019s four rooms is uninhabitable, the tenant could \nwithhold 25 percent of the rent. The tenant would have to pay the remaining 75 \npercent of the rent. Most courts use this method.  \nReasonable value of rental unit: The value of the rental unit in its defective \nstate is determined, and the tenant withholds that amount. The tenant would have \nto pay the difference between the rental unit\u2019s fair market value (usually the rent \nstated in the rental agreement) and the rental unit\u2019s value in its defective state.235 \n6. The tenant should save the withheld rent money and not spend it . The tenant may be \nrequired to pay the landlord some or all of the withheld rent. \n\u2022 If the tenant withholds rent, the tenant should try to put the withheld rent money \ninto a special bank account (called an escrow account ). The tenant should \nnotify the landlord in writing that the withheld rent money has been deposited in \nthe escrow account and explain why. \nDepositing the withheld rent money in an escrow  account is not required by law but is \na very good thing to do for three reasons. \nFirst, as explained under \u201cRisks\u201d on page 53 , rent withholding cases often wind up in \ncourt as a result of the landlord suing the tenant in an eviction case or in a monetary \ncase to recover the withheld rent. The judge usually will require the tenant to pay the \nlandlord some reduced rent based on the value of the rental unit with all of its defects. Judges rarely excuse payment of all rent. Depositing the withheld rent money in an escrow account ensures that the tenant will have the money to pay any \u201creasonable rent\u201d that the court orders. The tenant will have to pay the rent ordered by the court five days (or less) from the date of the court\u2019s judgment.  \nSecond, putting the withheld rent money in an escrow account proves to the court that \nthe tenant did not withhold rent just to avoid paying rent. If there is a court hearing, the judge will often ask the tenant if they set aside the rent. The tenant should bring rental receipts or other evidence to show that they have been reliable in paying rent in the past.  \nThird, it may strengthen a tenan\u2019 's position in their case to deposit the withheld rent \nmoney in an escrow account or set it aside, particularly if the defenses turn out to not be that strong. Tenants should contact their local legal aid organization for more information.  \nSometimes, the tenant and the landlord will be able to agree on the amount of rent \n56  that is reasonable for the time when the rental unit needed repairs. If the tenant and the \nlandlord cannot agree on a reasonable amount, the dispute will have to be decided in \ncourt, or resolved in an arbitration or mediation proceeding provided the parties included an arbitration or mediation clause in their rental agreement or subsequently have agreed to use arbitration or mediation to resolve their dispute (see page 106 ). Whether or not \nthe rental agreement contains an arbitration or mediation clause, landlords and tenants are encouraged to utilize dispute resolution programs (such as arbitration or mediation) \nin lieu of proceeding to court where possible since disputes submitted to dispute \nresolution can be resolved more quickly, less expensively, and the parties can avoid the adversity associated with litigation.  \nRisks: The defects may not be serious enough to threaten the tenant\u2019s health or  safety. \nIf the tenant withholds rent, the landlord may give the tenant a three- day notice to pay \nthe rent or quit. If the tenant refuses to pay, the landlord likely will file an unlawful \ndetainer action to evict the tenant. In the court action, the tenant will have to prove that \nthe landlord violated the implied warranty of  habitability.\n236 \nIf the tenant wins the case, the landlord can be ordered to make the repairs, and the \ntenant will be ordered to pay a reasonable rent amount, which may be less than the \nusual rent amount. The rent ordinarily must be paid five days or less from the date of the court\u2019s judgment. If the tenant wins but does not pay the amount of rent ordered when it is due, the judge will enter a judgment for the landlord, and the tenant may be evicted. If \nthe tenant loses, they will have to pay the rent, may be evicted, will be ordered to pay  \nthe landlord\u2019s court costs, and will likely be ordered to pay the landlord\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees \nif the rental agreement contains an attorney\u2019 's fees  clause.  \nThere is another risk of tenants withholding rent. The landlord may ignore the tenant\u2019s \nnotice of defective conditions and seek to remove the tenant by giving them a 30- day, \n60-day or 90 -day notice to move. This may amount to a \u201c retaliatory  act\u201d (see pages \n102-104).\n237 The l aw prohibits retaliation, but there are some limitations to this \nprotection.238 \nGiving the landlord notice  \nWhenever a tenant gives the landlord notice of the tenant\u2019s intention to repair and \ndeduct, withhold rent, or abandon the rental unit, it is suggested that the tenant put the \nnotice in writing. The notice should be in the form of a letter and can be typed or \nhandwritten. The letter should describe in detail the problem and the repairs that are \nrequired. The tenant should sign and date the letter and always keep a copy.239 \nThe tenant might be tempted to send the notice to the landlord by text message, e - \nmail, or fax. The laws regarding repairs specify that the tenant may give the landlord \nnotice orally or in writing, but do not mention text messaging, e- mail, or fax. To be \ncertain that the notice complies with the law, the tenant should follow up any texted, e - \nmailed, or faxed notice with a letter describing the damage or defects and the required repairs.  \nThe letter should be sent to the landlord, manager, or agent by certified mail (return \nreceipt requested). Sending the letter by certified mail is not required by law but is recommended. Or, the tenant (or a friend) may personally deliver the notice to the  \nlandlord, manager, or agent. The tenant should ask for a signed and dated receipt showing that the notice was received or ask the landlord to date and sign (or initial) the \n57  tenant\u2019s copy of the letter to show that the landlord received the notice. Whatever the \nmethod of delivery, it is important that the tenant obtain proof that the landlord, or the \nlandlord\u2019s manager or agent, received the notice.  \nThe copy of the letter and the receipt will serve as proof that the tenant notified the  \nlandlord, and also proof of what was contained in the notice. The tenant should keep a \ncopy of the letter and the receipt in case of a dispute with the landlord. The tenant also should take photographs or videos when possible to document the extent of the damage \nor defect.  \nThe landlord or agent may call the tenant to discuss the request for repairs or to \nschedule a time to make the repairs. It is recommended that the tenant keep notes of \nany conversations and phone calls about the request for repairs. During each conversation or immediately after it, the tenant should write down the date and time of the conversation, what both parties said, and the date and time that the tenant made the notes. It is important to note that neither the tenant nor the landlord can record a telephone conversation without the other party\u2019s permission.\n240 If a landlord gives a \nnotice that he/she will enter the unit to make repairs but never shows up, it is a good idea for the tenant to send the landlord a letter explaining that the landlord never showed up at the specified time. This will serve as proof if, in the future, the landlord tries to claim that the tenant did not allow entry.  \n \nTenant information  \nAn occupant of residential property can invite another person onto the property during \nreasonable hours, or because of emergency circumstances, to provide information about \ntenants\u2019 rights or to participate in a tenants\u2019 association or an association that advocates \nfor tenants\u2019 rights. The invited person cannot be held liable for trespass.\n241 \nLawsuit for damages as a remedy  \nThe remedies of repair and deduct, abandonment, and rent withholding allow a tenant \nin a rental unit with serious habitability defects to take action against the landlord without \nfiling a lawsuit. Arbitration and mediation are other methods of resolving disputes about the condition of a rental unit (see page 106).  \nA tenant has another option. The tenant can file a lawsuit against the landlord to \nrecover money damages if the landlord does not repair serious defects in the rental unit \nin a timely manner.\n242 For damages under $10,000, the tenant can file a lawsuit in the \nSmall Claims Court in the county where the property is located. In 2020, the jurisdictional \nlimit for Small Claims Court cases is $10,000 or less.  For damages above $10,000, the \ntenant will need to file his/her lawsuit in the Superior Court in the county  where the \nproperty is located.243 The tenant can file this kind of lawsuit without first trying another \nremedy, such as the repair and deduct remedy. It is important to note that according to the law, tenants cannot be represented by a lawyer in Small Claims Court cases, \nalthough many legal services organizations and court self -help centers have materials \nthat provide guidance.  \nIf the tenant wins the lawsuit, the court may award the tenant his or her actual \ndamages, plus \u201cspecial damages\u201d in an amount ranging from $100 to $5,000.\n244 \u201cSpecial \ndamages\u201d are costs that the tenant incurs, such as the cost of a motel room, because the landlord did not repair defects in the rental unit. The party who wins the lawsuit is \n58  entitled to recover his or her costs of bringing the suit (for example, court costs), plus \nreasonable attorney\u2019s fees as awarded by the court pursuant to any statute or the \ncontract of the part ies.245 While attorneys cannot appear in small claims court, a tenant \nmay still have had attorney\u2019s fees, for example for the preparation of a demand letter.  \nThe court also may order the landlord to abate (stop or eliminate) a nuisance and to \nrepair any substandard condition that significantly affects the health and safety of the \ntenant.246 For example, a court could order the landlord to repair a leaky roof and could \nretain jurisdiction over the case until the roof is fixed. This type of relief, called \u2018injunctive relief\u2019, is typically not available in small claims court , but Civil Code section 1942.4 \nallows for it. It should be noted that local code enforcement officials can also order the \nlandlord to correct violations by way of a \u201cNotice of Violation and Order to Abate\u201d. In \nfact, that is a necessary step for this type of affirmative lawsuit, as described in the \nfollowing.  \nIn order for a tenant to prevail in his/her affirmative lawsuit and recover actual and \nspecial damages against the landlord, all of the following conditions must be met.\n247 The \ntenant can still prevail in his/her affirmative claim without meeting these conditions but  \nwill not recover both actual and special damages. \n\u2022 The rental unit has a serious habitability defect that  endangers the health, life, safety, \nproperty, or welfare of the occupants or the public;  \n\u2022 A housing inspector has inspected the minimum requirements for habitability listed in \nthe eight categories on page 29; or has been declared substandard because, for \nexample, a structural hazard, inadequate sanitation, or premises liability and has \ngiven the landlord or the landlord\u2019s agent written notice of the landlord\u2019s obligation to \nrepair the substandard conditions or  abate the nuisance;  \n\u2022 The nuisance or substandard conditions continue to exist 35 days after the housing \ninspector mailed the notice to the landlord or agent, and the landlord does not have \ngood cause for failing to make the repairs;  \n\u2022 The nuisance or substandard conditions were not caused by the tenant or the \ntenant\u2019s family, guests, or pets; and  \n\u2022 The landlord collects or demands rent, issues a notice of rent increase, or issues a \nthree -day notice to pay rent or quit (see pages 85 -90) after all of the  above \nconditions have been met.  \nTo prepare for filing this kind of lawsuit, the tenant should take all of these basic \nsteps:  \n\u2022 The tenant should notify the landlord in writing about the conditions that require \nrepair (see \u201cGiving the landlord notice,\u201d pages 57 -58). The rental unit must have \nserious habitability defects that were not caused by the tenant\u2019s family, guests,  or \npets.  \n\u2022 The notice should specifically describe the defects and the repairs that are  required.  \n\u2022 The notice should give the landlord a reasonable period of time to make the repairs.  \n\u2022 If the landlord does not make the repairs within a reasonable time, the tenant should \ncontact the local city or county building department, health department, or local \nhousing agency and request an  inspection.  \n\u2022 The housing inspector must inspect the rental  unit. \n59  \u2022 The housing inspector must give the landlord or the landlord\u2019s agent written notice of \nthe repairs that are required.  \n\u2022 The substandard conditions must continue to exist 35 days after the housing \ninspector mailed the notice to the landlord or landlord\u2019s agent. The landlord must \nthen collect or demand rent, raise the rent, or serve a three -day notice to pay rent  or \nquit. \n\u2022 The tenant should gather evidence of the substandard conditions (for example, \nphotographs or videos, statements of witnesses, inspection reports) so that the \ntenant can prove his or her case in court. \n\u2022 The tenant should discuss the case with a lawyer, legal aid organization, tenant \nprogram, or housing clinic in order to under stand what the lawsuit is likely to \naccomplish, and also the risks  involved.248 \nResolving complaints out of court  \nBefore filing suit, the tenant should try to resolve the dispute out of court, either \nthrough personal negotiation or a dispute resolution program that offers mediation or \narbitration of landlord- tenant disputes. If the tenant and the landlord agree, a neutral \nperson can work with both of them to reach a solution. Informal dispute resolution can be inexpensive and fast (see \u201cArbitration and Mediation,\u201d pages 106 ). Please see pages 6 2- \n67 regarding legal requirements for notices. \nLANDLORD\u2019S SALE OF THE RENTAL UNIT  \nIf your landlord voluntarily sells the rental unit that you live in, your legal rights as a \ntenant are not changed. Tenants who have a rental agreement have the right to remain \nthrough the end of the rental agreement under the same terms and conditions. The new landlord may be able to end a periodic tenancy (for example, a month -to-month tenancy), \nbut only if allowed by law and after giving the tenant the required advance notice. The new landlord\u2019s ability to terminate the tenancy may be limited by the provisions of the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, in that just cause to terminate the tenancy may  be required (see \n\u201cLandlord\u2019s notice to end a periodic tenancy,\u201d pages 64- 68). \nThe sale of the rental unit does not change the rights of the tenants to have their \nsecurity deposits refunded when they move. Pages 78- 79 discuss the new landlord\u2019s \nresponsibility for the tenants\u2019 security deposits after the rental unit has been sold.  \nWhen property is sold in foreclosure  \nState law provides that a tenant or subtenant in possession of a rental housing unit \nunder a month- to-month rental agreement or periodic tenancy at the time a property is \nsold in foreclosure shall be given 90 days\u2019 written notice to quit before the tenant m ay be \nremoved from the property.\n249 In addition, a tenant or subtenant in possession of a rental \nhousing unit under a fixed- term residential rental agreement (such as a one- year rental  \nagreement) entered into before transfer of title at the foreclosure sale shall have the right \nto possession until the end of the term, except that the fixed- term tenancy may be \nterminated upon 90 day \u2019' written notice to quit if any of the following apply: (1) the \npurchaser in the foreclosure sale will occupy the housing unit as a primary residence; (2) \nthe tenant is the mortgagor or the child, spouse, or parent of the mortgagor; (3) the rental agreement was not the result of an arm \u2019' length transaction; or (4) the rent is much \nless than the fair market value of the property (unless the rent is reduced or subsidized \n60  due to federal, state or local subsidy or law such as a Section 8 voucher).250 \nFederal law requires that the purchaser at foreclosure of a dwelling in which a tenant \noccupies with a Section 8 voucher must continue the tenancy under the rental \nagreement and housing assistance payment contract, being entitled to the rights and bound by  the obligations of that program, unless they will occupy the dwelling as their \nprimary residence, in which case they must first give the tenant 90 days\u2019 notice to  \nvacate.\n251 \nCONDOMINIUM CONVERSIONS  \n \nA landlord who wishes to convert rental property into condominiums must obtain \napproval from the local city or county planning agency. The landlord also must receive \nfinal approval in the form of a public report issued by the California Department of Real \nEstate. Affected tenants must receive notices at various stages of the application and \napproval process.252 These notices are des igned to allow affected tenants and the public  \nto have a voice in the approval process.253 Tenants can check with local elected officials \nor housing agencies about the approval process and opportunities for public input.  \nPerhaps most important, affected tenants must be given written notice of the \nconversion to condominiums at least 180 days before their tenancies end due to the conversion.\n254 Affected tenants also must be given a first option to buy the rental unit on \nthe same terms that are being offered to the general public (or better terms). The tenants must be able to exercise this right for  at least 90 days following issuance of the \nDepartment of  Real Estate\u2019s public report.\n255 Local laws may provide additional \nrequirements and protections for tenants. \nDEMOLITION OF DWELLING  \nThe owner of a dwelling must give written notice to current tenants before applying for \na permit to demolish the dwelling. The owner also must give this notice to tenants who \nhave signed rental agreements but who have not yet moved in ( see page 30). The notice \nmust include the earliest approximate dates that the owner expects the demolition to \noccur and the tenancy to end.256 \nINFLUENCING THE TENANT TO MOVE  \nCalifornia law protects a tenant from retaliation by the landlord because the tenant \nhas lawfully exercised a tenant right ( see pages 102 -104). California law also makes it \nunlawful for a landlord to attempt to influence a tenant to move out by doing any of the \nfollowing:  \n\u2022 Engaging in conduct that constitutes theft or  extortion.  \n\u2022 Using threats, force, or menacing conduct that interferes with the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of \nthe rental unit. Quiet enjoyment means you have the right to full  use and enjoyment of the rental \nunit free from substantial interference from the landlord. (Menacing conduct by the landlord \nmust be of a nature that would create the fear of harm in a reasonable person.)  \n\u2022 Committing a significant and intentional violation of  the rules  limiting the landlord\u2019s \nright to enter the rental unit (see pages  44-45).257 \nA landlord does not violate the law by giving a tenant a warning notice, in good faith, \nthat the tenant\u2019s or a guest\u2019s conduct may violate the rental agreement, rules or laws. \nThe notice may be oral or in writing. The law also allows a landlord to give a tenant an \n61  oral or written explanation of the rental agreement, rules or laws in the normal course of  \nbusiness.258 \nIf a landlord engages in unlawful behavior as described above, the tenant may sue \nthe landlord in small claims court or Superior Court. If the tenan t prevails, the court may \naward them a civil penalty of up to $2,000 for each violation.259 Before filing a lawsuit, \nthe tenant should be mindful that lawsuits can be very contentious, stressful, expensive \nand continue for extended periods of time. If you are faced with actions similar to those \ndescribed above, try to assess the situation realistically. You may want to discuss the \nsituation with a tenant advisor, or a lawyer who represents tenants. You should \nconsider whether the landlord\u2019s actions have a discriminatory motive, in which case you \nshould contact a local fair housing organization, a local legal aid organization or the \nCalifornia Department of Fair Employment and Housing. If you are convinced that you cannot work things out with the landlord, then consider your legal remedies.  \n \n \nMOVING OUT  \n \n \nGIVING AND RECEIVING PROPER NOTICE  \nTenant\u2019s notice to end a periodic tenancy  \nA periodic tenancy is a tenancy that continues weekly or monthly with no specified \nend date. To end a periodic tenancy (for example, a month- to-month agreement), the \ntenant must give the landlord proper written  notice before moving. Even a periodic -term \nagreement entered into orally requires proper  written notice.  \nThe law requires the tenant  to give the landlord the same amount of notice as there \nare days in the rental term.260 This means that if you have a month- to-month tenancy, \nyou must give the landlord written notice at least 30 days before you move. If you are in \na week -to-week tenancy, you must give the landlord written notice at least seven days \nbefore you move. This is true even if the landlord has given you a 60 -day notice to end \na month- to-month rental agreement and you want to leave sooner  (see discussion, \npage 85-86).261 \nIf the rental agreement specifies a different amount of notice (for example 10 days), \nthe tenant must give the landlord written notice as required by the agreement.262 \nTo avoid later disagreements, date the notice, state the date that you intend to move, \nand always make a copy of the notice for yourself. Although the law provides tenants \nwith several options for delivering your notice to the landlord, it is recommended t hat you \ndeliver the notice to the landlord or property manager in person or mail it by certified mail \nwith return receipt requested. You can also serve the notice by one of the methods described under \u201cProper Ser vice of Notices,\u201d pages 89- 90.\n263 \nYou can give the landlord notice any time during the rental period, but you must pay \nfull rent during the period covered by the notice. For example, say you have a month -to- \nmonth rental agreement, and pay rent on the first day of each month. You could giv e \nnotice any time during the month but  are required to leave within 30 days of giving your \nnotice. For instance, if you give your notice on September 10th, then you must leave on or \nbefore October 10th and you are responsible for rent through October 10th (i.e., 20 days of \nSeptember and 10 days of October). The prior example was based on a month with 30 \n62  days. If you give the same 30- day notice on the 10th day of a month in a month with 31 \ndays, your time period to move out would fall on the 9th day of the following month. \n(Exception : You may not have to pay rent for the entire 30 -day period if you moved out \nbefore the end of the 30 days and the landlord rented the unit to another tenant who \nmoved in before the end of the 30 -day period and started paying rent.)264 \nThe rental agreement must state the name and address of the person or entity to \nwhom you must make rent payments (see pages 24-26). If this address does not accept \npersonal deliveries, you can mail your notice to the owner at the name and address stated in the rental agreement. If you can show proof that you mailed the notice to the stated name and address (for example, a receipt for certif ied mail), the law assumes that \nthe notice was received by the owner on the date of  postmark.\n265 \nSpecial rights of tenants who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, or elder/dependent adult  abuse.  \nYou may notify your landlord that you or another household member has been a \nvictim of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, or elder/dependent adult abuse and that you intend to move out and terminate your lease early. You are able to terminate your lease with 14 days\u2019 notice (instead of the normal 30 days\u2019 notice), without penalty, if you provide written notice to your landlord that you intend to move out due to your or a household member being a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, or elder/dependent adult  abuse.  \nYou would still be responsible for payment of the rent for 14 days following your \nnotice, unless the landlord is able to re- rent your unit within that time period.\n266 You are \nrequired to attach to your notice to the landlord a copy of the restraining order, \nemergency  protective order, or police report, within 180 days of the day such order or \nreport was issued or made, or provide a statement by a qualified third party including a domestic violence advocate, sexual assault advocate, human trafficking advocate, doctor, r egistered nurse, licensed clinical social worker, or psychologist.  \nIf a tenant terminates their lease early due to domestic violence, sexual assault, \nstalking, human trafficking, or elder abuse, the landlord must return the security deposit withou t penalty for early termination.\n267 A landlord that violates this requirement may be \nliable to the tenant in a civil action for actual damages and up to $5,000 in statutory \ndamages.268 \nIf the person subject to the restraining order or emergency protective order is also a \ntenant of the unit, that person is still responsible for upholding their end of the rental \nagreement.269 \nA landlord cannot end or refuse to renew your tenancy based upon the fact that you or \na member of your household is the victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, \nhuman trafficking,  or elder/dependent adult abuse.270 Such actions may also invoke \nprotections based on fair housing law as well as tenant law. Furthermore, a landlord cannot evict you for calling for police or emergency assistance on your own behalf as a \nvictim of crime, victim of abuse, or person in an emergency if you believed the assistance \nwas necessary.\n271 \nIf you request that the landlord change your locks and the landlord  fails to do so within \n24 hours of your request, you may then change the l ocks yourself.272 \nIn the context of a number of federally assisted housing programs, the Violence \n63  Against Women Act (VAWA) offers protections for victims of domestic violence, dating \nviolen ce, sexual assault, or stalking.273 Such protections include, but are not limited to, \nthe ability to request an emergency transfer to a safe unit, the ability to remove the \nabuser from the lease, and protection from eviction or subsidy termination because of \nthe abuse.  Covered housing programs include programs such as public housing, the \nSection 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, Project -Based Section 8 housing, Low-\nIncome Housing Tax Credit housing, and USDA Rural Development Multifamily housing \nprograms, among other federal programs. An attorney can help you figure out if VAWA \nprotections apply in your case. For general information about VAWA housing protections and a longer list of covered programs, please see this pamphlet from the National \nHousing Law Project:  https://www.nhlp.org/wp -content/uploads/VAWA -Brochure-  \nEnglish -and-Spanish- combined.pdf . \n \nLandlord\u2019s notice to end a periodic tenancy  \nA landlord can end a periodic tenancy (for example, a month- to-month or week -to- \nweek tenancy) by giving the tenant proper advance written notice. Your landlord must  \ngive you 60 days, and for certain tenancies 90- days, advance written notice that the \ntenancy will end. If you, and every other tenant or resident, have lived in the rental \nunit for a year or more the notice must be 60- days.274 If the landlord is terminating a \ntenancy involving rental assistance the notice must be 90- days.275 However for non -\nassisted tenancies, the landlord may give you 30 days advance written notice in \neither of the following situations: \n\u2022 Any tenant or resident has lived in the  rental unit less than one year;276 or \n\u2022 The landlord has contracted to sell the rental unit to another person who intends to \nreside in it for at least a full year after the tenancy ends. In addition, all of the \nfollowing must be true in order for the selling landlord to give you a 30- day notice:  \n- The landlord has contracted to sell the dwelling unit and has opened escrow \nwith a licensed escrow agent, title insurance company, or a real estate broker;  \n- The landlord must have given you the 30 -day notice no later than 120 days \nafter opening the escrow;  \n- The landlord must not previously have given you a 30- day or 60- day notice;  \n- The purchaser is a natural person or persons (not a partnership, LLC, corporation,  etc.);  \n- The purchaser in good faith intends to reside in the property for at least one full year after the termination of the  tenancy,  \n- The rental unit must be one that can be sold separately from any other \ndwelling unit. For example, a hous e or a condominium can be sold separately \nfrom another dwelling unit.\n277 \n \nPrior to the enactment of the Tenant Protection Act (effective January 1, 2020) the \nlandlord was not required to state a reason for ending the tenancy when using a 30- day \nor 60 -day notice; however, the Tenant Protection Act, if applicable to the rental unit, \nrequires just cause for termination of periodic tenancies, \u201cwhich shall be stated in the \nwritten notice to terminate tenancy (see 30 -Day or 60 -Day Notice, page 85 ).\u201d278 For \n64  tenancies with rental assistance, depending on the source of that assistance, a 90- day \nnotice may be required to state a reason. However, for rental units now covered by that \nlaw, a landlord will need to have just cause to terminate a tenancy and state that cause in the notice (see discussion of the Tenant Protection Act on pages 67-68 and the  \nTenant Protection Act Fact Sheet).\n279 The landlord can serve the 30 -day, 60- day or 90- \nday notice by certified or registered mail or by one of the methods described under \u201cProper Ser vice of Notices,\u201d pages 89-90.\n280 \nAny of the above discussed landlords\u2019 notices to terminate a periodic tenancy must \nalso include the following statement:281 \n\u201cState law permits former tenants to reclaim abandoned personal property left at the former address of the tenant, subject to certain conditions. You may or may not be able to reclaim property without incurring additional costs, depending on the cost of st oring the property and the length of time before it is reclaimed. In general, \nthese costs will be lower the sooner you contact your former landlord after being notified that property belonging to you was left behind after you moved out.\u201d \nNote: In the circumstances described on pages 85-86, a landlord can give you just three \ndays advance written notice.  \nIf you receive a 30- day, 60- day, or 90- day notice, you must leave the rental unit by the \nlater of the date specified in the notice or the end of the 3\n0th, 60th, or 90th  day as specified \nin your notice. Otherwise, your landlord may file an unlawful detainer lawsuit against you (see page 90- 91). For example, if the landlord served a 60 -day notice on July 16, you \nwould begin counting the 60 days on July 17, and the 60 -day period would end on \nSeptember 14. If September 14 falls on a weekday, you would have to leave on or before that date. However, if the last day of the notice falls on a Saturday, Sunday or \nlegal holiday, you would not have to leave until the next day that is not a Saturday,  \nSunday or legal holiday.\n282 \nIf you do not move out by the end of the notice period (i.e., the date in the notice or \nthe end of the notice period), the landlord may file an unlawful detainer lawsuit to evict \nyou (see page 90- 91). \nWhat if the landlord has given you a 60- day notice, but you want to leave sooner?  \nYou should give the landlord the same amount of notice as there are days between rent payments (for example, if you pay your rent every 30 days, then you should provide your landlord with 30 days\u2019 notice)  provided that \u2014 \n\u2022 The number of days of your notice t o your landlord is not less than the number of \ndays between rent payments,  and \n\u2022 Your proposed termination date is before the landlord\u2019s termination  date.283 \nWhat if the landlord has given you a 30- day, 60 -day or 90- day notice, but you want to \ncontinue to rent the property because you believe that you have not done anything to cause the landlord to give you a notice of termination, or that the landlord is retal iating \nagainst you for exercising your rights? In this kind of situation, you can try to communicate with the landlord and come to an agreement where the landlord withdraws the notice and allows you to stay. Try to find out why the landlord gave you the notice. If  \nthe issue is something within your control (for example, consistently late rent, or playing music too loud), assure the landlord that in the future, you will pay on time or keep the \n65  volume turned down. Then, keep your promise. If the landlord refuses to withdraw the \nnotice, you will have to move out at the end of the notice period or  be prepared for the \nlandlord to file an unlawful detainer lawsuit to evict you. If you believe the landlord has \nacted in retaliation against you, you can raise the landlord\u2019s retaliation as a defense at trial in the landlord\u2019s unlawful detainer action or assert it as part of a new lawsuit against the landlord for retaliation after you vacate or move out of  the rental unit. In either event, \nyou should consider the nature and extent of the landlord\u2019s alleged retaliation before \nasserting it as a defense or affirmative claim and you should always keep copies for \nyour records of all communications between the landlord and you.\n284 \nIn addition to provisions of the Tenant Protection Act, special rules may apply in cities \nor counties with rent stabilization ordinances. It is important to know whether you live in \na unit covered by a local rent stabilization ordinance. For example, in some jurisdictions \nwith rent stabilization ordinances, the landlord cannot end a periodic tenancy without a good faith \u201c just cause\u201d or \u201cgood cause\u201d reason to evict, which may supersede the \nTenant Protection Act in certain situations. In these jurisdictions, the landlord must state \nthe reason for the termination, and the reason may be reviewed by local housing authorities.  \nSpecial rules also apply to tenants who participate in certain federal housing \nprograms, such as the Section 8 housing voucher program, project- based Section 8 \nhousing, and the Low Income Housing Tax Credit programs. While the rental agreement \nis in effect, the landlord must have good cause to terminate (end) the tenancy.\n285 This \nmeans that the landlord cannot end your tenancy without  a specific reason. Examples of \ngood cause include failing to pay your rent, serious or repeated violations of the rental agreement, or criminal activity that threatens the health or safety of other residents.\n286 \nHowever, incidents of domestic violence may not be used against  the victim or \nthreatened victim as good cause for the landlord to terminate the tenancy or  occupancy \nrights of the victim.287 \nTo terminate the tenancy of a tenant who participates in the Section 8 Housing Choice \nVoucher program, the landlord must first give the tenant the applicable three- day or 90 - \nday notice of termination under California law288 (see pages 85 -88), and the landlord \nmust give the public housing agency a copy  of the notice at the same time.289 If the \nlandlord simply decides not to renew the rental agreement, or decides to terminate the HAP (housing assistance payment) contract, the landlord must give the tenant 90 days\u2019 advance written notice of the terminati on date, to occur on or after the expiration date of \na rental agreement for a fixed- term.\n290 If the tenant does not move out by the end of the \n90 days, the landlord must follow Cal ifornia law to evict the tenant.291 \nLikewise, if a landlord has served a 3- day type of notice for a violation that either is \nnot corrected, or is for those limited violations that cannot be corrected, and the tenant has also not quit the premises, the landlord must follow Cal ifornia law to evict the \ntenant.\n292 \nIf the tenancy is protected by local just cause for eviction laws, or the 2019 Tenant \nProtection Act, the landlord must have a valid reason justifying \u201ccause\u201d to terminate the tenancy, such as the tenant\u2019s failure to pay rent.\n293 Even if the tenant is not at fault, the \nlandlord can terminate the tenancy if the landlord has just cause, such as the property will be demolished, substantially remodeled, or occupied by the landlord or his or her close family member. However, in situations where the tenant is not at fault, but the \n66  landlord has just cause to terminate, the landlord will often be obligated to pay the tenant \nrelocation assistance\u2014either equal to one month\u2019s rent under the Tenant Protection Act or different relocation assistance amounts under applicable local ordinances.\n294 \nIf you live in government financed or subsidized housing, or in an area with rent \ncontrol, check with your local housing officials or a housing counseling agency to see if any special rules apply in your situation.  \nTENANT PROTECTION ACT OF 2019  \nThe Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (\u201cTenant Protection Act\u201d) (AB 1482) establishes \nlimitations on rent increases and requires just cause for terminating certain tenancies. The bill established Civil Code sections 1946.2 (just cause) and 1947.12 (rent limitations). The Tenant Protection Act is complex  and the following serves as an  \noverview and summary of its just cause termination of tenancy provisions.\n295 \u202fFor \nfurther detail see the Tenant Protection Act Fact Sheet.  \nGenerally, properties covered by the just cause requirement are rental units in \ncomplexes with two or more units and the complex is at least 15 years old and are not \nalready covered by local just cause protections. Regardless of age, a duplex in which the owner occupies a unit is exempt, as are many, but not all, single- family homes and \ncondominiums. Tenants in single- family homes and condominiums that qualify  for \nexemption must be notified of the exemption with a specified written notice or rental agreement term in order for the landlord to actually be exempt.  \nThe law specifies two types of just cause that a landlord can cite as grounds for \nterminating a tenancy. These are \u201cat fault\u201d and \u201cno fault\u201d  cause.\n296  \nAt fault cause can be any of the following:  \n\u2022 failure to pay rent ;  \n\u2022 violating a material term of their rental agreement, often allowing the violation \nto go uncorrected after written notice  to correct;  \n\u2022 subletting or assigning the property in violation of the lease;  \n\u2022 refusing to renew a lease on similar terms to an expiring one; \n\u2022 refusing to allow the owner to enter the property when authorized;  \n\u2022 maintaining a nuisance or committing waste on the property; \n\u2022 using the property for criminal or unlawful purposes; \n\u2022 failure of an employee or agent to vacate housing provided in connection with their duties following termination from those duties; or \n\u2022 failing to deliver possession of the property after providing the tenant  with \nwritten  notice or agreement to do so.\n297 \n \nNo fault cause would be any of the following:  \n\u2022 removing the unit from the rental market ; \n\u2022 the owner\u2019s intent to occupy the unit for themselves or their family members  \n(exceptions may apply for mobilehome leases); \n67  \u2022 the owner complying with an ordinance or government order to vacate the \npremises;  or \n\u2022 the owner\u2019s intent to demoli sh or  substantial ly remodel the premises .298 \nIn situations where the reason for just cause can be cured, the owner is required to give \nthe tenant notice and an opportunity to resolve the problem.299 If the violation is not \nresolved, a three -day notice terminating the tenancy may be served. No fault \nterminations require the landlord to either pay the tenant one month\u2019s rent to assist with \nrelocation or forgive their last month\u2019s  rent.300 \nIn addition to limitations as to property type, just cause under the Tenant Protection \nAct applies only under certain conditions of tenure of the tenants. It applies if a tenancy has been in place for 12 months or more. However, if any adult is added to occupancy in \nthe unit before any tenant has resided there for 24 months, then the protection does not \napply until all tenants have resided in the unit for 12 months or any tenant has resided there continuously for 24 months.\n301 \nADVANCE PAYMENT OF LAST MONTH\u2019S RENT  \nMany landlords require tenants to pay \u201clast month\u2019s rent\u201d at the beginning of the \ntenancy as part of the security deposit or at the time the security deposit is paid. Almost without exception what a residential landlord calls \u201clast month\u2019s rent\u201d is really nothing other than a security deposit. The security deposit law, Civil Code section 1950.5, places strict limits on the advance payment of rent and characterizes any money given to the landlord, except for an application fee and the first month\u2019s rent, as security deposit.\n302 \nREFUND OF SECURITY DEPOSITS  \nCommon problems and how to avoid them  \nOne of the most common disagreements between landlords and tenants is over the \nrefund of the tenant\u2019s security deposit after the tenant has moved out of the rental unit. California law, therefore, specifies procedures that the landlord must follow for refunding, using, and accounting for tenants\u2019 security deposits . \nCalifornia law specifically allows the landlord to use a tenant\u2019s security deposit for four  \npurposes:  \n\u2022 For unpaid rent; \n\u2022 For cleaning the rental unit when the tenant moves out, bu t only to make the \nunit as clean as it was when the tenant first moved in;303 \n\u2022 For repair of damages, other than normal wear and tear, caused by the tenant or the tenant\u2019s guests;  and\n \n\u2022 If the rental agreement allows it, for the cost of restoring or replacing \nfurniture, furnishings, or other items of personal  property (including keys), \nother than because of normal wear and tear.304 \nA landlord cannot refuse to return your entire security deposit simply because you \nlived in the unit. A landlord can withhold from the security deposit only those amounts \nthat are reasonably necessary for the purposes outlined above. The security deposit \ncannot be used for repairing defects that existed in the unit before you moved in, for \nconditions caused by normal wear and tear during your tenancy or previous tenancies, \n68  or for cleaning a rental unit that is as clean as it was when you moved in.305 A rental \nagreement can never state that a security deposit is \u201cnonrefundable.\u201d306 \nA landlord also cannot withhold a tenant\u2019s partial or full security deposit based solely \non the tenant being a victim of domestic violence and/or terminating their lease early as \ndescribed previously.  \nUnder California law , your landlord has 21 days from the date that you moved out to:  \n\u2022 Send you a full refund of your security deposit,  or \n\u2022 Mail or personally deliver to you an itemized statement that lists the amounts \nof any deductions from your security deposit and the reasons for the deductions, together with a refund of any amounts not deducted.\n307 \nThe landlord should not send a \u201cstatement\u201d to you via e- mail unless you have \npreviously agreed with the landlord to rec eive the \u201cstatement\u201d via e -mail.308 If you have \nnot agreed to receive the \u201cstatement\u201d via e- mail, you should provide your landlord with \nyour forwarding address and provide the U.S. Postal Service with instructions to forward \nyour mail to your new address. The landlord is obligated to mail the \u201cstatement\u201d to your \n\u201clast known address,\u201d which would be the address of the rental unit that you moved out of if the landlord does not have a current address for you.\n309 \nThe landlord also must send you copies of receipts for the charges that the landlord  \nincurred to repair or clean the rental unit and that the landlord deducted from your security deposit. Receipts for services should include the hourly rate and amount of time spent, both of which must be reasonable and not be excessive. The landlord must include the recei pts with the itemized statement.\n310 The landlord must follow these rules:  \n\u2022 If the landlord or the landlord\u2019s employees did the work\u2014The itemized statement must describe the work performed, including the time spent and the hourly rate charged. The hourly rate must be reasonable.\n \n\u2022 If another person or business did the work \u2014The landlord must provide \nyou copies of the person\u2019s or business\u2019 invoice or receipt. The landlord must provide the person\u2019s or business\u2019 name, address, and telephone number on the invoice or receipt, or in the itemized statement.\n \n\u2022 If the landlord deducted for materials or supplies\u2014The landlord must provide you a copy of the invoice or receipt. If the item used to repair or clean the unit is something that the landlord purchases regularly or in bulk, the landlord must reasonably document the i tem\u2019s cost (for example, by an \ninvoice, a receipt or a vendor\u2019s price list).\n311 \n\u2022 If the landlord made a good faith estimate of charges\u2014The landlord is allowed to make a good faith estimate of charges and include the estimate in the itemized statement in two situations: (1) the repair is being done by the landlord or an employee and cannot reasonably be completed within the 21 days, or (2) services or materials are being supplied by another person or \nbusiness and the landlord does not have the invoice or receipt within the 21 days. In either situation, the landlord may deduct the estimat ed amount from \nyour security deposit. In the situation where services or materials are being supplied by another person or business, the landlord must include the name, \n69  address and telephone number of the person or business that is supplying the \nservices or materials.  \n\u2022 Within 14 calendar days after completing the repairs or receiving the invoice or \nreceipt, the landlord must mail or deliver to you a correct itemized statement, \nthe invoices and receipts described above, and any refund to which you are \nentitled.312 \nThe landlord is not required to send you copies of invoices or receipts, or a good faith \nestimate, if the total deductions are less than $125, or if you waive your right to receive them.\n313 If you wish to waive the right to receive these documents, you may do so by \nsigning a waiver when the landlord gives you a 30 -day, 60-day or 90- day notice to end \nthe tenancy (see  pages 85- 86), when you give the landlord a 30 -day notice to end the \ntenancy (see pages 57-58), when the landlord serves you a three -day notice to end the \ntenancy (see pages 85-88), or after any of these notices. If you have a rental \nagreement, you may waive this right no earlier than 60 days before the term ends. The waiver form given to you by the landlord must include the text of the security deposit law   \nthat describes  your right to receive receipts.\n314 Tenants should understand the \nconsequences before agreeing to waive their right to such documentation.  \nWhat if the repairs cost less than $125 or you waived your right to receive copies of \ninvoices, receipts and any good faith estimate? The landlord still must send you an itemized statement 21 calendar days or less after you move, along with a refund of any  \namounts not deducted from your security deposit. When you receive the itemized statement, you may decide that you want copies of the landlord\u2019s invoices, receipts, and any good faith estimate. You may request copies of these documents from the landlord \nwithin 14 calendar days after you receive the itemized statement. It is best to make this \nrequest both orally and in writing. Always keep a copy of your written communication.  \nThe landlord must send you copies of invoices, receipts and  any good faith estimate \nwithin 14 calendar days after they receive your request.\n315 \n \n70   \nInitial Inspection Before Tenant Moves Out  \n \nA tenant can and should ask the landlord to inspect the rental unit before the tenancy \nends. This helps you to know ahead of time what repairs, if any, are necessary. This will \nalso keep the landlord from adding charges for unidentified repairs later. During this \u201cinitial \ninspection,\u201d the landlord or the landlord\u2019s agent identifies defects or conditions that justify deductions from the tenant\u2019s security deposit. This gives the tenant the opportunity to do the identified cleaning or repairs in order to avoid deductions from the security deposit. The tenant has the right to be present during the inspection.  \nThe landlord must perform an initial inspection as described above if requested by the \ntenant. However, a landlord cannot conduct an initial inspection unless one is requested \nby the tenant. A landlord is not required to perform an initial inspection if the landlord has \nserved the tenant with a three -day notice (an eviction notice) for one of the reasons \nspecified in footnote 298.\n316 \nLandlord\u2019s notice  \nThe landlord must give the tenant written notice of the tenant\u2019s right to request an \ninitial inspection of the rental to take place during the last 14 days of the tenancy, and to be present during the inspection. The landlord must give this notice to the tenant within a \u201creasonable time\u201d after either the landlord or the tenant has given the other written notice of intent to terminate (end) the tenancy ( see pages 62-67 and 82 -85). If the tenant has a \nfixed term rental agreement, the landlord must give the tenant this notice within a \u201creasonable time\u201d before the rental term ends. If the tenant does not request an initial inspection, the landlord has no duties with respect to the initial inspection described above.\n317 \nThe landlord\u2019s notice must also include the following statem ent:318 \nState law permits former tenants to reclaim abandoned personal property left at the former address of the tenant, subject to certain conditions. You may or may not be able to reclaim property without incurring additional costs, depending on the cost of storing the property and the length of time before it is reclaimed. In general, these \ncosts will be lower the sooner you contact your former landlord after being notified that property belonging to you was left behind after you moved out. \nScheduling the inspection  \nWhen the tenant  requests  an initial inspection,  the landlord and the tenant  must  try \nto agree on a mutually convenient date and time for the inspection. The inspection cannot be scheduled earlier than two weeks before the end of the rental term. The inspection should be scheduled to allow the tenant  ample time to perform  repairs  or do \ncleaning identified during the initial inspection, tenants generally should not schedule \nthe inspection on their last day in possession.\n319 If the tenant has requested an \ninspection, the landlord must give the tenant at least 48 hours advance written notice of the date and time of the inspection whether or not the parties have been able to agree to a date and time for the inspection.  The landlord is not required to give the 48-\nhour notice  to the tenant  if: \n \n71  \u2022 The parties have not agreed on a date and time, and the tenant withdraws the request \nfor the inspection, in which case the inspection will not be conducted; or \n\u2022 The landlord and tenant agree in writing to waive (give up) the 48- hour notice \nrequirement.  \nItemized statement  \nThe landlord or the landlord\u2019s agent may perform the inspection if the tenant is not \npresent, unless the tenant previously withdrew their request for an inspection.320 \nBased on the findings in the inspection, the landlord or agent must prepare an itemized \nstatement of repairs or cleaning that the landlord or agent believes the tenant should \nperform in order to avoid deductions from the tenant\u2019s security deposit. The landlord or \nagent must give the statement to the tenant if the tenant is present for the inspection or  \nleave it inside the unit if the tenant is not present.321 The landlord or agent also must give the \ntenant a copy of the sections of California\u2019s security deposit statute that list lawful uses of \ntenants\u2019 security deposits.322 \nThe security deposit statute has the effect of limiting the kinds of repairs or cleaning \nthat the landlord or agent may properly include in the itemized statement. Because of this \nstatute, the landlord cannot, for example, use the tenant\u2019s security deposit  to repair \ndamages or correct defects in the rental that existed before the tenant moved in or are the \nresult of ordinary wear and tear.323 Since the landlord cannot use the tenant\u2019s deposit to \ncorrect these kinds of defects, the landlord or agent cannot list them in the itemized statement.  \nBefore the tenancy ends, the tenant may make the repairs or do the cleaning \ndescribed in the itemized statement, as allowed by the rental agreement, in order to av oid \ndeductions from the deposit.\n324 However, the tenant cannot be required to repair defects \nor do cleaning if the tenant\u2019s security deposit could not be used properly to pay for that \nrepair or cleaning.  \nFinal inspection  \nThe landlord may perform a final inspection after the tenant has moved out of the \nrental. The landlord may make a deduction from the tenant\u2019s security deposit to repair a \ndefect or correct a condition:  \n\u2022 That was identified in the inspection statement and that the tenant did not repair or \ncorrect; or  \n\u2022 That occurred after the initial inspection;  or \n\u2022 That was not identified during the initial inspection due to the presence of \nthe tenant\u2019s possessions.325 \n\u2022 Any deduction must be reasonable in amount and must be for a purpose permitted by \nthe security deposit statute.326 Twenty -one calendar days (or less) after the tenancy \nends, the landlord must refund any portion of the security deposit that remains after the \nlandlord has made any lawful deductions ( see pages 31- 34, 68-80).327 \n \n \n72   \nExample \nSuppose that you have a month- to-month tenancy, and that you properly give your \nlandlord 30 days\u2019 advance written notice that you will end the tenancy. A few days after the \nlandlord receives your notice, the landlord gives you written notice that you may request an \ninitial inspection and be present during the inspection. A few days after that, the landlord \ntelephones you, and you both agree that the landlord will perform the initial inspection at \nnoon on the 14th day before the end of the tenancy. Forty -eight hours before the date and \ntime that you have agreed upon, the landlord gives you a written notice confirming the date \nand time of the inspection.  \nThe landlord performs the initial inspection at the agreed time and date, and you are \npresent during the inspection. Suppose that you have already removed some of your \npossessions, but that your sofa remains against the living room wall. When the landlord completes the inspection, the landlord gives you an itemized statement that lists the following items, and also gives you a copy of the required sections of the security deposit \nstatute. The itemized statement lists the following:  \n\u2022 Repair cigarette burns on window sill. \n\u2022 Repair worn carpet in front of couch.  \n\u2022 Repair door jam  chewed by your dog. \n\u2022 Wash the windows.  \n\u2022 Clean soap scum in bathtub.  \nSuppose that you scrub the bathtub until it sparkles, but don\u2019t do any of the repairs or \nwash the windows. After you move out, the landlord performs the final inspection. Twenty- \none days after the tenancy ends, the landlord sends you an itemized statement  of \ndeductions, along with a refund of the rest of your security deposit. Suppose that the itemized statement lists deductions from your security deposit for the costs of repairing the windowsill, \nthe carpet and the door jamb, and for washing the windows. Has the landlord acted properly?  \nWhether the landlord has acted properly depends on other facts. Suppose that the \ncigarette burns were caused by a previous tenant and that the carpet in the room with the \ncouch was 10 years old. According to the security deposit statute, the cigarette burns are \ndefective conditions from another tenancy, and the worn carpet is normal wear and tear, even if some of it occurred while you were a tenant.  The statute does not allow the landlord to \ndeduct from your security deposit to make these repairs.\n328  However, the landlord can \ndeduct a reasonable amount to repair the door jamb chewed by your dog because this \ndamage occurred during your tenancy a nd is more than normal wear and tear. 329 \n \n \n \n73  Suppose that the windows were dirty when you moved in, and that they were just as \ndirty when you moved out. According to the security deposit statute, the windows are in \n\u201cthe same state of cleanliness\u201d as at the beginning of your tenancy. The statute does not allow the landlord to deduct from your security deposit to do this cleaning.\n330 Also, with \nregards to dirt on the exterior of the windows there is an argument that a tenant is only \nresponsible for dirt caused by themselves or their gues ts and dirt on the exterior of \nwindows is caused by the environment not the tenant. \nNow suppose that while you were moving out, you broke the glass in the dining room \nlight fixture and found damage to the wall behind the sofa that you caused when you moved in. Neither defect was listed in the landlord\u2019s itemized statement. Suppose that your landlord nonetheless makes deductions from your security deposit to repair these \ndefects. Has the landlord acted properly in this  instance?  \nThe landlord has acted properly, as long as the amounts deducted are reasonably  \nnecessary for the repairs made.\n331 Both of these defects are more than normal wear and \ntear, and the landlord is allowed to make deductions for defects that occur after the initial \ninspection, as well as for defects that could not be discovered because of the pres ence of \nthe tenant\u2019s belongings.332 \n \nSuggested Approaches to Security Deposit Deductions  \n \nCalifornia\u2019s security deposit statute specifically allows the landlord to use a tenant\u2019s \nsecurity deposit for the four purposes stated on page 68. The statute limits the landlord\u2019s \ndeduction from the security deposit to an amount that is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for the \nlisted purposes.333 \nUnfortunately, the terms \u201creasonably necessary\u201d and \u201cnormal wear and tear\u201d are \nvague and mean different things to different people. The following suggestions are \noffered as practical guides for dealing with security deposit issues. While these \nsuggestions are consistent with the law, they are not necessarily the law in this area.  \n1. Costs of cleaning  \nA landlord may properly deduct from the departing tenant\u2019s security deposit the amount \nnecessary to make the rental unit as clean as it was when the tenant moved in.334 \nA landlord cannot routinely charge each tenant for cleaning carpets, drapes, walls, or \nwindows in order to prepare the rental unit for the next tenancy. Instead, the landlord must \nlook at how well the departing tenant cleaned the rental unit, and may charge cleaning \ncosts only if the departing tenant left the rental unit (or a portion of it) less clean than when \nthey moved in. Reasonable cleaning costs would include the cost of such things as \neliminating flea infestations left by the tenant\u2019s animals, cleanin g the oven, removing decals \nfrom walls, removing mildew in bathrooms, defrosting the refrigerator, or washing the \nkitchen floor. But the landlord could not charge for cleaning any of these conditions if they \nexisted at the time that the departing tenant moved in. In addition, the landlord could not  \n \n \n \n \n74   \ncharge for the cumulative effects of wear and tear. Suppose, for example,  that the tenant  \nhad washed the kitchen  floor but that it remained  dingy  because of wax built up over the \nyears. The landlord could not charge the tenant for stripping the built-up wax from the \nkitchen  floor.  \nThe landlord is allowed to deduct from the tenant\u2019s security deposit only the reasonable \ncost of cleaning the rental unit.335 \n2. Carpets and drapes \u2014 \u201cuseful life\u201d rule \nNormal wear and tear to carpets, drapes and other furnishings cannot be charged \nagainst a tenant\u2019s security deposit.336 Normal wear and tear includes simple wearing \ndown of carpet and drapes because of normal use  or aging and includes moderate dirt \nor spotting. In contrast, large rips or indelible stains justify a deduction from the \ntenant\u2019s security deposit for repairing the carpet or drapes or  replacing them if that is \nreasonably necessary.  \nOne common method of calculating the deduction for replacement prorates the total \ncost of replacement so that the tenant pays only for the remaining useful life of the item \nthat the tenant has damaged or destroyed. For example, suppose a tenant has damaged \nbeyond repair an eight -year-old carpet that had a life expectancy of ten years, and that a \nreplacement carpet of similar quality would cost $1,000. The landlord could properly charge \nonly $200 for the two years\u2019 worth of life (use) that would have remained if the tenant had \nnot damaged the carpet.  \n3. Repainting  walls  \nOne approach for determining the amount that the landlord can deduct from the \ntenant\u2019s security deposit for repainting, when repainting is necessary, is based on the \nlength of the tenant\u2019s stay in the rental unit. This approach assumes that interior paint \nhas a two- year life. (Some landlords assume that interior paint has a life of three years \nor more.)  \n \nLength of Stay  Deduction  \nLess than 6 months  full cost  \n6 months to 1 year  two-thirds of cost  \n1 year to 2 years  one-third of cost  \n2 or more years  no deduction  \nIn general charging for painting is only allowable if it is necessary because of \ndamage beyond normal wear and tear to painted surfaces or because of soiling that \ncannot be reasonably cleaned. Using the above approach, if the tenant lived in the \nrental unit for two years or more, the tenant could not be charged for any repainting \ncosts, no matter how dirty the walls were.337 This is particularly true when the landlord \nhas a standard business practice of repainting units between most tenancies.  \n \n \n \n75  4. Other damage to walls  \nGenerally, minor marks or nicks in walls are the landlord\u2019s responsibility as normal wear \nand tear (for example, worn paint caused by a sofa against the wall). Therefore, the tenant \nshould not be charged for such marks or nicks. However, a large number of holes in the \nwalls or ceiling that require filling with plaster, or that otherwise require patching and \nrepainting, could justify withholding the cost of repainting from the tenant\u2019s security deposit. \nIn this situation, deducting for painting would be more likely to be proper if the rental unit \nhad been painted recently, and less likely to be proper if the rental unit needed repainting \nanyway. Generally, large marks or paint gouges are the tenant\u2019s r esponsibility.338 \n5. Common sense and good faith \nRemember : These suggestions are not hard and fast rules. Rather, they are offered \nto help tenants and landlords avoid, understand, and resolve security deposit \ndisputes.  \nSecurity deposit disputes often can be resolved, or avoided in the first place, if the \nparties exercise common sense and good judgment, and deal with each other fairly and in good faith (see page 28). For example, a landlord should not deduct from the tenant\u2019s security deposit for normal wear and tear, and a tenant should not try to avoid \nresponsibility for damages that the tenant has caused.  \nThe requirement that the landlord send the tenant copies of invoices and receipts with \nthe itemized statement of deductions (see pages 68-70) may help avoid potential security \ndeposit disputes. Before sending these items to the tenant,  the landlord has the \nopportunity to double check them to be sure that the amounts deducted are reasonable, \naccurate and reasonably necessary for a purpose specified by the security deposit statute. Before challenging the deductions, the tenant has the opportunity to review and carefully evaluate the documentation provided by the landlord. Straightforward conduct by both parties at this stage may avoid or minimize a dispute over deductions from the tenant\u2019s security  deposit.  \nEspecially in disputes about security deposits, overreaching by one party only \ninvites the other party to take a hard line. Disputes that reach this level often become unresolvable by the parties and wind up in court.  \n \n \n76  What should you do if you believe that your landlord has made an improper deduction \nfrom your security deposit, or if the landlord keeps all of the deposit without good \nreason?  \nTell the landlord or the landlord\u2019s agent why you believe that the deductions from your \nsecurity deposit are improper. Immediately ask the landlord or agent for a refund of the \namount that you believe you\u2019re entitled to get back. You can make this request orally or \nin writing, but if you request it orally you should follow up with a letter and always keep a copy. The letter should state the reasons that you believe the deductions are improper, and the amount that you feel should be returned to you. Keep a copy of your written communication. It is recommended that you send the letter (if you elected the preferred communication via letter) to the landlord or agent by certified mail and to request a \nreturn receipt to prove that the landlord or agent received the letter. Or, you can deliver \nthe letter personally and ask the landlord or agent to acknowledge receipt by signing and dating your copy of the  letter.  \nIf the landlord or agent still does not send you the refund that you think you are \nentitled to receive, try to work out a reasonable compromise that is acceptable to both of you. You also can suggest that the dispute be mediated by a neutral third person o r \nagency (see page 106- 107). You can contact one of the agencies listed on pages 105 -\n106 for assistance. If none of this works, you may want  to take legal action (see page \n79). If you  believe there is evidence that the landlord has engaged in \u201cbad faith \nretention\u201d of some or all or your deposit, the security deposit law contains a provision that may cause the landlord to be more willing to settle the matter, rather than taking it  to \ncourt. You can request that the court, or the court on its action, can award up to twice the total s ecurity deposit as statutory damages if the court finds that the landlord is \nengaged in such \u201cbad faith\u201d action (see further discussion below).\n339 Making sure the \nlandlord is aware of this provision may lead them to be more inclined to resolve the dispute.  \nWhat if the landlord does not provide a full refund, or a statement of deductions and a \nrefund of amounts not deducted, by the end of the 21- day period as required by law?  \nAccording to a California Supreme Court decision, the landlord loses the right to keep \nany of the security deposit and must return the entire deposit to you.\n340 Even so, it may \nbe difficult for you to get your entire deposit back from the landlord.341 The landlord may \nstill claim damages for unpaid rent, repairs, and cleaning either as a defense for a set -off \nagainst the security deposit or by an affirmative counter claim against you (see the \ndiscussion on page 68). You should contact one of the agencies listed on pages 105-\n106 for advice.  \nPractically speaking, you have two options if the landlord does not honor the 21- day \nrule. The first step under either option is to call and write the landlord to request a refund \nof your entire security deposit. You can also suggest that the dispute be mediated. If the landlord presents good reasons for keeping some or all of your deposit for a purpose  \nlisted on page 68, it is probably wise to enter into a reasonable compromise with the landlord. This is because the other option is difficult and the outcom e may  be uncertain.  \nThe other option is to sue the landlord in small claims court or Superior Court for \nreturn of your security deposit. Keep in mind that you will have to file that suit in a court with jurisdiction over either the location of the property or the location whe re the rental \n77  agreement was signed or otherwise entered into. This can present problems if you are \nmoving away from the area where the property is located, especially if you are moving \nout-of-state. While it is recommended that an action at court be commenced promptly, \nyou will have up to 4 years to sue pursuant to a written rental agreement and 2 years pursuant to an oral one.\n342 Keep in mind that the landlord can file a counterclaim \nagainst you. In the counterclaim, the landlord can assert a right to make deductions from the deposit, for example, for unpaid rent or for damage to the rental unit that the \nlandlord alleges that you caused. The landlord also can seek to recover for damage or \nunpaid rent that exceeds the security deposit. Each party then will have to argue in court  why they are entitled to the deposit or, in the landlord\u2019s case, damages or unpaid \nrent that exceeds the security deposit.\n343  Also, understand that you,  as a Plaintiff in \nsmall claims court, will have no right to appeal a decision on your claim with which you \ndisagree. You will, however, have the right to appeal the decision in a landlord\u2019s \ncounterclaim.  \nRefund of security deposits after sale of building  \nWhen a rental unit is sold, the selling landlord must do one of two things with the \ntenants\u2019 security deposits. The selling landlord must either transfer the security deposits \nto the new landlord or return the security deposits to the tenants following the sale.344 \nBefore transferring the security deposits to the new landlord, the selling landlord may \ndeduct money from the security deposits. Deductions can be made for the same reasons \nthat deductions are made when a tenant moves out (for example, to cover unpaid rent ). \nIf the selling landlord makes deductions from the security deposits, they must transfer the balance of the security deposits to the new landlord.\n345 The new landlord becomes \nlegally responsible upon receipt of the security  deposit.346 \nThe selling landlord must notify the tenants of the transfer in writing. The selling \nlandlord must also notify each tenant of any amounts deducted from the security deposit \nand the amount of the deposit transferred to the new landlord. The written notice must also include the name, address, and telephone number of the new landlord. The selling landlord must send this notice to each tenant by first -class mail, or personally deliver it to  \neach tenant.\n347 \nThe new landlord becomes legally responsible for the secur ity deposits when the \nselling landlord transfers the deposits to the new landlord.348 \nIf the selling landlord returns the security deposits to the tenants, the selling landlord \nmay first make lawful deductions from the deposits (see pages 68 -80). The selling \nlandlord must send each tenant an itemized statement that lists the amounts of and \nreasons for any deductions from the tenant\u2019s  security deposit, along with a refund of any \namounts  not deducted (see pages 68 -80).349 \nIf the selling landlord fails to either return the tenants\u2019 security deposits to the tenants \nor transfer them to the new owner, both the new landlord and the selling landlord are \nlegally responsible to the tenants for the security deposits.350 If the selling landlord and \nthe security deposits cannot be found, the new landlor d must refund all security deposits \n(after any proper deductions) as tenants move out.351 \nThe new landlord cannot charge a new security deposit to current tenants simply to \nmake up for security deposits that the new landlord failed to obtain from the selling landlord. But if the security deposits have been returned to the tenants, or if the new  \n78  landlord has properly accounted to the tenants for proper deductions taken from the \nsecurity deposits, the new landlord may legally collect new security deposits.352 \nIf the selling landlord has returned a greater amount to a tenant than the amount of \nthe tenant\u2019s security deposit, after allowing for legitimate deductions, the new landlord \nmay utilize this ability to collect a \u201c new\u201d deposit to recoup an amount of deposit that \nshould otherwise be in their possession.353 \nCan the new landlord increase the amount of your security deposit? This depends, in \npart, on the type of tenancy that you have. If you have a fixed- term rental agreement, the \nnew landlord cannot increase your security deposit during the term unless this is  \nspecifically allowed by the rental agreement. For periodic tenants (those renting month- \nto-month, for example) the new landlord can increase security deposits only after giving \nproper advance written notice, and if local law, such as a rent control ordinance, does not prohibit changing the terms of your tenancy or increasing the security deposit. In \neither situation, the total amount of the security deposit after the increase cannot be \nmore than the legal limit (see pages 31- 34). The landlord normally cannot require that \nyou pay the security deposit increase in cash or electronic funds transfer without  offering  \nother options (see page 38). \nAll of this means that it is important to keep copies of your rental agreement and the \nreceipt for your security deposit. You may need those records to prove that you paid a \nsecurity deposit, to verify the amount, and to determine whether either a previous  or \ncurrent landlord had a right to make a deduction from the deposit.\n354 \nLegal actions for obtaining refund of security deposits  \nSuppose that your landlord does not return your security deposit as required by law \nor makes improper deductions from it. If you cannot successfully resolve the problem \nwith your landlord, you can file a lawsuit in small claims court (for claims not exceeding  \n$10,000) or Superior Court for the amount of the security deposit plus court costs, and \npossi bly also a penalty and interest.355 If your claim is for a little more than $10,000, you \ncan waive (give up) the extra amount and still use the small claims court. For amounts \ngreater than $10,000, you must file in Superior Court, and you ordinarily will need a \nlawyer in order to effectively pursue your case. In such a lawsuit, the landlord has the burden of proving that his or her deductions from your security deposit were \nreasonable.\n356\u202f \nIf you prove to the court that the landlord acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d in refusing to return your \nsecurity deposit, the court can order the landlord to pay you the amount of the \nimproperly withheld deposit, plus up to twice the amount of the security deposit as a \n\u201cbad faith\u201d penalty. The court can award a bad faith penalty in addition to actual damages whenever the facts of the case warrant \u2014even if the tenant has not requested \nthe penalty.\n357 These additional amounts can also be recovered if a landlord who has \npurchased your building makes a \u201cbad faith\u201d demand for replacement of security deposits. The landlord has the burden of proving the authority upon which the demand \nfor the security deposits was based.\n358 \nWhether you can collect attorney\u2019s fees if you win such a suit depends on whether the \nrental agreement contains an attorney\u2019s fee clause.359 If the rental agreement contains \nan attorney\u2019s fee clause, you can claim attorney\u2019s fees as part of the judgment, even if  \n \n79  the clause states that only the landlord can collect attorney\u2019s fees.360 However, you can \nonly collect attorney\u2019s fees if you were represented by an  attorney.361 \nTENANT\u2019S DEATH \nIf a tenant dies during the term of the tenancy, the tenant\u2019s estate as overseen by an  \nexecutor or administrator will be responsible financially for rent through the remainder of \nthe term, despite the tenant\u2019s death. For instance, if the tenant had a fixed term rental agreement (i.e., a rental term of six months or one year) and dies, the tenant\u2019s estate will \nbe responsible for the remainder of the six -month or one- year rental term. The tenant\u2019s \nestate may surrender the tenancy and return possession back to the landlord, but the \ntenant\u2019s estate will remain responsible financially unless and until the landlord re- lets the \nrental unit. The landlord must make a good faith effort to re -let the unit to minimize or \neliminate the liability of the tenant\u2019s estate for future rent. If the tenant had a periodic tenancy (i.e., week to week or month to month) and dies, the tenancy is terminated (ended) by notice of the tenant\u2019s death and the tenancy ends on the 30th day following the tenant\u2019s last payment of  rent before the tenant\u2019s death.\n362 No notice (other than the notice \nto the landlord of the tenant\u2019s death) is required to terminate the tenancy.363 There still \nmight be issues involving the return of the tenant\u2019s personal belongings after the termination of the tenancy (see page 1 00). \nMoving out at the end of a rental agreement  \nA fixed -term rental agreement expires automatically at the end of the term unless the \nterms of the agreement provide otherwise.\n364 At the expiration of the fixed -term rental \nagreement, the tenant is expected to renew the rental agreement (with the landlord\u2019s  \nconsent) or move out if the tenancy is not covered by just cause for eviction protections, \nsuch as a local rent -control ordinance, just cause ordinance, or the Tenant Protection \nAct of 2019 (the \u201cTenant Protection Act\u201d). The Tenant Protection Act covers all tenancies where the tenant has resided at the rental unit for more than 12 months or 24 months if \nan adult tenant has been added to the rental agreement in the last 12 months.\n365 If the \ntenancy is subject to just cause for eviction protections, the tenancy continues on a month -to-month basis at the end of the rental term and will continue until either the \ntenant gives notice of move- out or the landlord has a valid reason under the law to \nterminate the tenancy.  \nMost fixed -term rental agreements do not require a tenant to notify their landlord at \nthe expiration of their rental agreement that they do not intend to renew. As a courtesy, \nhowever, the tenant may want to consider giving the landlord notice that they intend to move out and not renew their rental agreement. \nIf you do not have just cause eviction protections and continue living in the rental unit \nafter the rental agreement expires, the landlord has two options. The landlord can \nproceed with an eviction proceeding to remove you from the rental unit or treat you as a \nholdover tenant. If the landlord accepts rent from you after the end of your term, you will automatically become a holdover tenant and can continue legally to occupy the rental unit. Your new tenancy will be a periodic tenancy  and the length of your tenancy will be \ndetermined based on the length of time between your rent payments (for example,  \nmonthly rent payments result in a month- to-month tenancy). With the exception of the \nrental term, which is now a periodic tenancy, all other provisions of the rental   \n80  agreement will remain in effect.366 Keep in mind that if the tenancy becomes a per iodic \none, the terms can be changed with proper written notice as allowed by law.367 \nFor rental units not covered by a local rent -control ordinance, just cause ordinance, or \nthe Tenant Protection Act of 2019, the landlord can file an eviction lawsuit immediately \nwithout giving you notice (see page 82 -89) if you do not move out at the expiration of \nyour rental term and the landlord refuses to accept rent after the rental term expires.  \nImportant: If the tenant wants  to renew his/her rental agreement, the tenant should \nbegin negotiating with his/her landlord in plenty of time before the rental term expires. \nBoth the landlord and tenant will have to agree to the terms of a new rental agreement. \nThis process may take some time if  one or both parties wants to negotiate different \nprovisions in the new rental agreement. If the tenant has just cause eviction protections, the tenant may not be required to renew his/her tenancy and sign a new rent al \nagreement unless the landlord presents the tenant with a new lease containing terms substantially similar to the expiring rental agreement.  \nSpecial Rules for Tenants in the Military  \nA servicemember may terminate (end) a rental agreement any time after entering \nthe military or after the date of the member\u2019s military orders. This right applies to a tenant who joins the military after signing a rental agreement, and to a servicemember who signs a rental agreement and then receives orders for a change of permanent \nstation or deployment for at least 90 days. \nThe servicemember must give the landlord or the landlord\u2019s agent written notice of \ntermination and a copy of the orders. The servicemember may personally deliver the notice to the landlord or agent, send the notice by private delivery service (such as FedE x or UPS), or send it by certified mail with return receipt requested. Proper \ntermination relieves a servicemember\u2019s dependent, such as a spouse or child, of any obligation under the rental agreement.  \nWhen rent is paid monthly, termination takes effect 30 days after the next rent due \ndate that follows delivery of the notice. Rent must be paid on a prorated basis up to the \ndate that the termination takes effect. If rent or lease amounts have been paid in \nadvance for any period following the effective date of termination, the landlord must \nrefund these amounts within 30 days after the effective date.\n368 \nExample: The servicemember pays $600 rent on the tenth of each month under the \nterms of his or her lease. The servicemember pays the rent on June 10, and then \npersonally gives the landlord proper notice of termination on June 15. The date that termination takes eff ect is August 9 (30 days after the July 10 rent due date). The \nservicemember must pay $600 rent on July 10 for the period from July 10 through August 9. By September 8, the landlord must return any rent paid in advance for the \nperiod after the effective date of termination. The landlord also must return any \u201clease  \namounts paid in advance\u201d (such as the unused portion of the servicemember\u2019s \nsecurity deposit) by September 8.  \nTHE INVENTORY CHECKLIST  \nYou and the landlord or the landlord\u2019s agent can use the inventory checklist (see \npages 123- 126) to both document the condition of the unit when you move in and again \nif you request, as recommended, an initial inspection of the rental unit before you move \n81  out (see pages 71-73). The landlord is not obligated to participate in using the \u201cCondition \nUpon Arrival\u201d portion of the checklist at move -in, but it is still good practice for a tenant to \nuse it, along with taking date stamped pictures, to document any pre- existing \ndeficiencies or lack of  cleanliness.  \nFor the initial move- out inspection, you and the landlord or agent should agree on a \nmutually convenient date and time for the inspection during the last two weeks before \nthe end of the tenancy or the term. It is recommended that tenants not wait until the  last \nday of the tenancy to schedule their inspections because tenants may find themselves \nwithout time to repair or clean items noted during the inspection. You and the landlord or \nagent should walk through the rental unit at that time and complete the \u201cCondition Upon Initial Inspection\u201d portion of the checklist. \nAfter you have moved out, the landlord can use the \u201cCondition Upon Departure\u201d \nportion of the checklist to conduct the final inspection ( see pages 123 -126). Most \nlandlords prefer to conduct their final inspection after the tenant has removed all of his/her belongings and returned legal possession of the unit to the landlord. Although landlords are not required by law to permit tenants to attend the final inspection, if possible, it is recommended that tenants try to be present when the landlord conducts his/her final inspection. Prior to moving out, tenants are encouraged to clean the rental unit and repair damaged or broken items to improve the  likelihood of receiving a full \nrefund of their security deposit.  \nBoth you and the landlord or agent should sign and date the inventory checklist after \neach inspection. (The landlord or agent should sign the checklist even if you\u2019re not \npresent.) Be sure to get a copy of the signed form after each inspection.  \nSee additional suggestions regarding the inventory checklist on page 123, and \n\u201cRefunds of Security Deposits,\u201d pages 68- 80. \n \n \nTERMINATIONS AND EVICTIONS  \n \n \nCOVID -19 RELIEF  FOR EVICTIONS : On February 9, 2022, the Governor signed \ninto law SB 115  to extend the availability of financial assistance provided by  the \nTenant Relief Act to protect  tenants and landlords impacted by the COVID -19 \npandemic. For tenants  who were unable to pay their rent between March 1, 2020 \nthrough September 30, 2021 due to financial distress arising from or related to \nCOVID -19, the Act provided a moratorium on evictions during that time period \nprovided the tenant s timely returned to their  landlords a signed declaration of COVID -\n19-Related Financial Distress.369 For tenants and landlords, the Act provided financial \nassistance for unpaid rent and utilities from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022.370  \nOn October 17, 2022, Governor Newsom announced that the COVID -19 State of \nEmergency would  expire effective February  28, 2023.  While state \nprocesses/procedures returned  to their pre -state of emergency status, emergency  \nassistance by local jurisdictions  may have continued beyond that date. For more \ninformation about the availability of local relief and the Tenant Relief Act, please go to \nhttps://housing.ca.gov/ . \n82  Although the Tenant Relief Act influences discussions in this chapter, this chapter \nis written with a focus on the law governing tenancy terminations and tenant evictions \noccurring before March 1, 2020 and after September 30, 2021.  \nWHEN CAN A LANDLORD TERMINATE A TENANCY?  \nLandlords of residential real property covered by the Tenant Protection Act must \nnotify their tenants of the act\u2019s  protections.371 For rental agreements in effect before July \n1, 2020, the landlord must provide their tenants with written notice by August 1, 2020. For rental agreements entered into or renewed after July 1, 2020, landlords must include \nthe notice as an addendum to the lease or provide the notice to the tenant and obtain the tenant\u2019s signature acknowledging receipt. The notice must contain the following language:  \n\u201cCalifornia law limits the amount your rent can be increased. See Section 1947.12 of \nthe Civil Code for more information. California law also provides that after all of the tenants have continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 12 months or more or at least one of the tenants has continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 24 months or more, a landlord must provide a statement of cause in any notice to terminate a tenancy. See Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code for more information.\u201d \nThe sections of the Tenant Protection Act relevant to just cause evictions are \nsummarized below. The sections relevant to rent increases are summarized starting on page 35. \nA landlord\u2019s ability to terminate the tenancy and evict the tenant is based on whether \nor not their  rental unit is subject to local just cause for eviction laws or the state\u2019s  Tenant \nProtection Act. If a rental unit is subject to both local and state just  cause for eviction \nlaws, the Tenant Protection Act\u2019s just cause protections do not apply if the local ordinance was adopted on or before September 1, 2019, or it was adopted or amended after September 1, 2019 and provides stronger protections to the tenant .\n372 The Tenant \nProtection Act\u2019s just cause protections apply statewide and cover rental units where the tenant has resided at the unit for more than 12 months or 24 months  if an additional \nadult tenant was added to the rental agreement less than 12 months ago .\n373 Certain \ntypes of housing units are exempt from the Tenant Protection Act, including:  \n\u2022 transient and tourist hotel occupancy;  \n\u2022 housing accommodations in a nonprofit hospital, religious facility, extended care \nfacility or licensed residential care facility for the  elderly;  \n\u2022 dormitories owned and operated by an institution of higher education or a school \nfor grades kindergarten through 12th grade;  \n\u2022 housing accommodations in which the tenant shares bedroom or kitchen \nfacilities with the owner who maintains their principal residence at the property;  \n\u2022 single -family owner -occupied residences;  \n\u2022 a duplex in which the owner occupied one of the units as the owner\u2019s principal place of residence at the beginning of the tenancy and continues to occupy that unit;  \n\u2022 housing that has been issued a certificate of occupancy within the previous 15 years; or  \n\u2022 residential real property that is alienable separate from the title to any other \ndwelling unit provided that the landlord has notified the tenants that the rental \n83  unit is exempt from the Tenant  Protection Act.374 \nIf the Tenant Protection Act applies, then the landlord cannot terminate the tenancy or \nevict the tenant without just cause. The Tenant Protection Act defines just cause as \neither \u201cAt -fault just cause\u201d or \u201cNo -fault just cause.\u201d375 At-fault just cause includes: failure \nto pay part or all of the rent; a breach of a material term of the rental agreement; engaging in criminal activity or committing nuisance or waste at the rental unit; the  \ntenant\u2019s refusal to execute a written extension or renewal of the rental agreement with \nthe same or similar provisions as the original agreement after the landlord\u2019s written \nrequest or demand; assigning or subletting the rental unit in violation of the ren tal \nagreement; the tenant\u2019s refusal to permit the landlord to enter the rental unit as required by law or the terms of the rental agreement; using the rental unit for an unlawful purpose; failure to vacate when the tenant\u2019s employment with the landlord ter minates; \nand failure to deliver possession of the rental unit to the landlord after providing the landlord with written notice of tenant\u2019s intent to do so.\n376 No-fault just cause includes:  \nlandlord\u2019s intent to occupy the rental unit for him/herself or his/her spouse, domestic \npartner, children, grandchildren, parents, or grandparents if the tenant agrees in writing \nto the termination or the rental agreement permits the landlord to terminate under these \ncircumstances; withdrawal of the rental unit from the rental market; an order by a court or government agency for the tenant to vacate the rental unit due to habitability issues;  \nor landlord\u2019s intent to demolish or substantially remodel the rental unit.\n377 \nIf the landlord is relying on at -fault just cause as the basis to terminate the tenancy \nand evict the tenant, then the landlord must provide the tenant with an opportunity to \ncorrect the violat ion if the violation is curable.378 In such cases, the landlord must give \nthe tenant notice of the violation and an opportunity to cure or correct it. Only if the tenant does not cure or correct the violation within the ti meframe set forth in the notice \nmay the landlord serve a three- day notice to quit without an opportunity t o cure to \nterminate the tenancy.\n379 \nIf the landlord is relying on no- fault just cause as the basis to terminate the tenancy \nand evict the tenant, then the landlord must provide the tenant with relocation assistance \nirrespective of the tenant\u2019s income.380 The relocation assistance is an amount equal to \none month of the tenant\u2019s rent that was in effect when the owner issued the notice to \nterminate the tenancy and, at the landlord\u2019s option, the landlord may pay this amount \ndirectly to the tenant or waive the tenant\u2019s obligation to pay their final month\u2019s rent. The \nlandlord\u2019s termination notice must notify the tenant that the landlord is terminating the \ntenancy based on no- fault just cause and inform the tenant of the landlord\u2019s election \nbetween paying relocation assistance to the tenant or waiving the tenant\u2019s final month \nrent. If the tenant fails to move out and return possession of the rental unit back to the \nlandlord within the timeframe set forth in the termination notice, the landlord may recover \nthe amount of relocation assistance paid to the tenant as damages in an action to \nrecover possession.381 \nSeparate and apart from the Tenant Protection Act, landlords are prohibited from \nevicting a tenant (or refusing to renew a tenant\u2019s lease) based on acts of domestic \nviolence, sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, elder abuse, or dependent adult \nabus e committed against the tenant where the tenant (1) has obtained a restraining \norder or pol ice report that is not older than 180 days and (2) does not live with the  \nabuser.382 The landlord may evict the perpetrator of the acts, but not the victim, \n84  under California law.  \nIf the rental unit is not protected by just cause eviction protections, a landlord can \nterminate (end) a periodic tenancy by giving the tenant advance written notice of 30 \ndays, 60 days, or, in some instances, 90 days. (For an explanation of periodic tenancies, see page 22; for an explanation of 30- day, 60- day and 90 -day notices, see pages 62 -67 \nand 85- 86.) \nIf the rental unit is covered either by a local or state just cause eviction law and the \nlandlord has provided the tenant with a notice to cure a violation as discussed above, the tenant must cure the violation within the timeframe set forth in the notice. If the tenant \nfails to cure the violation, the landlord may serve a three- day notice to quit without  \nproviding the tenant an opportunity to cure for rental units covered by the Tenant Protection Act. Within three days of the date that the landlord serves the notice to quit, \nthe tenant must move out of the rental unit and return possession of it back to the \nlandlord or face possible eviction by the landlord. If the rental unit Is not covered either by a local or state just cause eviction law and the landlord has given the tenant a 30- day, \n60-day, or 90- day notice, the tenant must move out of the rental unit and return \npossession of It back to the landlord within the timeframes set forth in the notice or face possible eviction by the landlord. If the landlord wishes to proceed with evicting the \ntenant then the landlord must file with the Superior Court in the county where the property is located an unlawful detainer complaint, obtain from the court a summons, and serve the summons along with a copy of the cour t-filed complaint on the tenant.  \nWRITTEN NOTICES OF TERMINATION  \n30-day, 60- day, or 90 -day notice  \nA landlord who wants to terminate (end) a periodic tenancy can do so by properly \nserving a written 30 -day, 60- day, or, in certain instances, 90- day, notice on the tenant.  \nHow to respond to a 30 -day, 60- day or 90- day notice  \nIf your rental unit is not covered by local or state just cause for eviction requirements \nand the landlord has properly served you with a notice to terminate the tenancy you may \neither prepare to move out or try to make arrangements with the landlord to remain past \nthe deadline in the notice. If you want to continue to occupy the rental unit, ask the landlord what you need to do to make that possible.  Most landlords will provide you with \nan explanation although not required to do so unless the rental unit is covered by a local or state just cause for eviction requirement. If the landlord will permit you to stay, you should memorialize the agreement in writing, retain a signed copy for your records, and \nthe landlord should withdraw their notice to terminate in writing.  \nIf the reason the landlord has given for terminating your tenancy is an act of domestic \nviolence, sexual assault, human trafficking, stalking or elder/dependent abuse committed \nagainst you, explain that to the landlord. For instance, if there was a loud argument and broken window that disturbed other tenants, and the cause of it was an act of domestic violence, the tenant should not have to leave if they take steps to remove the abuser and do not allow the abuser to return to the property. If you live in a federally assisted \nproperty covered by the Violence Against Women Act, survivors of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, and stalking are protected from eviction for reasons based on the abuse. Federally assisted landlords or public housing authorities (where \n85  appropriate) are required to provide a notice outlining VAWA rights when a household is \nbeing evicted, as well as a self -certificati on form.383 Survivors can use that form to \ndemonstrate abuse occurred and seek VAWA protections. A lawyer, legal aid \norganization or tenant advocate can help you determine if VAWA applies in your case.  \nIf the landlord and you are unable to reach agreement on you remaining past the \ndeadline set forth in the notice to terminate, then you will be required to move out and \nmust do so by the end of the time period set forth in the notice. If the last day of the landlord\u2019s notice is more than 30 -days in the future you can choose to give your own \n30- day notice that will expire before the landlord\u2019s notice if you desire to move out \nbefore the deadline set forth in the landlord\u2019s notice to terminate. Just be certain that you can actually move according to your own notice, because failing to do so could subject you to a court eviction action. When you move out, take all of your personal belongings with you, and leave the rental unit at least as clean as when you rented it. This will help with the refund of your security deposit (see \u201cRefund of Security Deposits,\u201d pages 68- 80). \nIf you have not moved at the end of the notice period, you will be unlawfully occupying \nthe rental unit after that day, and the landlord can file an unlawful detainer ( eviction) \nlawsuit to evict you.  \nIf you believe that the landlord has acted unlawfully in giving you the notice, or that \nyou have a valid defense to an unlawful detainer lawsuit, you should consult with a \nlawyer, legal aid organization, tenant advocate, or housing clinic (see \u201cGetting Hel p \nFrom a Third Party,\u201d pages 105- 106).  \nThree -day notice  \nPrior to giving the tenant a three- day pay or quit notice, for rental units covered by \nlocal or state just cause eviction requirements, including the Tenant Protection Act, the landlord must give a tenant an opportunity to cure or correct any violations pr esuming \nthe violations can be cured or corrected. Only after the tenant fails to cure or correct the violations within the timeframes set forth in the notice may a landlord give the tenant a three -day notice to quit without an opportunity to cure. For rental units not covered by \nlocal or state just cause eviction requirements, a landlord may give a tenant a three- day \nnotice either to pay or quit or cure or quit if the tenant has done, among other things,  any \nof the acts specified above on page 82.\n384 As stated above, landlords are prohibited from \nevicting a tenant based on acts of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, elder abuse, or dependent  adult abuse committed against the tenant where \nthe tenant (1) has obtained a restraining orde r or police report that is not older than 180 \ndays and (2) does not live with the abuser.\n385 The landlord may evict the perpetrator of \nthe acts, but not the victim, under California law. If the tenant lives in a property covered by the Violence Against Women Act (as discussed above), the housing provider or  \npublic housing authority (where appropriate) must ensure that the tenant receives a \nnotice outlining VAWA rights when a household is given the three -day notice, as well as  \na VAWA self -certification form.\n386 \nIf the landlord gives the tenant a three- day notice because the tenant has not paid the \nrent, the notice must accurately state the amount of rent that is due. In addition, the notice must state:  \n\u2022 The name, address and telephone number of the person to whom the rent must  be \n86  paid.  \n\u2022 If payment may be made in person, the usual days and hours that the person is \navailable to receive the rent payment. If the address does not accept personal \ndeliveries, then you can mail the rent to the owner at the name and address stated in \nthe three -day notice. If you can show proof that you mailed the rent to the stated \nname and address (for example, a receipt for certified mail), the law assumes that \nthe landlord received the rent payment on the date that the payment was  mailed.  \n\u2022 Where the notice does not require payment in person, the notice may state the \nname, street address and account number of the financial institution where the rent \npayment may be made (if the institution is within five miles of the unit). If an \nelectronic fund transfer procedure was previous ly established for paying rent, \npayment may be made using that  procedure.387 \nWith some exceptions, the landlord cannot require that the tenant pay the past -due \nrent in cash or by electronic funds transfer without offering other options (see page 38 ). \nIf the three -day notice is based on a reason other than non -payment of rent, the \nnotice must either describe the tenant\u2019s violation of the rental agreement or  describe the \ntenant\u2019s other improper conduct. The three -day notice must be properly served on the \ntenant (see pages  89-90). \nDepending on the type of violation, the three- day notice demands either (1) that the \ntenant correct the violation or leave the rental unit (quit) or (2) that the tenant leave the \nrental unit (quit) because the law deems the violation \u201cnon- curable\u201d. For cur able \nviolations, the notice must be clearly written in the alternative (i.e. pay or quit; perform a covenant of the agreement or quit). If the violation involves something that the tenant can correct (for example, the tenant has not paid the rent, or the tenant has a pet,  but \nthe rental agreement does not permit pets), the notice must give the tenant the option to correct the violation.  \nMost violations can be corrected, such as failing to pay rent. In these situations, the \nthree -day notice must give the tenant the option to correct the violation. However, the \nother acts listed on page s 86-87 cannot be corrected, and the three -day notice can \nsimply order the tenant to leave at the end of the three days.  \nIf the violation is correctable, it is important to cure the violation within three court \ndays of receiving the three- day notice and keep proof that you have done so. If you pay \nthe rent that is due or correct a correctable violation of the rental agreement during the \nthree -day notice period, the tenancy continues, and the landlord cannot legally evict \nyou.\n388 Please note that the landlord is not required to accept partial rent payment.  \nThe time period covered in the three -day notice to pay or quit is important. If you \nattempt to pay all the past -due rent demanded after the three- day period expires, the \nlandlord either can refuse to accept the payment and file a lawsuit to evict you or accept  \nthe rent payment. If the landlord accepts the rent, the landlord waives (gives up) the \nright to evict you based on late payment of rent.389 \nSee page 89  on how to count the days in the three- day notice.  \n \n87  How to respond to a three- day notice  \nSuppose that your landlord properly serves you with a three- day notice because you \nhave not paid the rent. You must either pay the full amount of rent that is due or vacate \n(leave) the rental unit by the end of the third court day, unless you have a legal basis for \nnot paying rent or the amount of rent that the landlord is attempting to charge you is incorrect, either because you have been overcharged or because there are bad conditions in your unit, such as conditions that your landlord has failed to repai r. (See \npages 48- 50). You might see if the landlord will accept a partial payment and/or give \nsome additional time to \u201ccure\u201d the non- payment. If you get such an agreement,  be sure \nto get it in writing with the landlord\u2019s signature. Your failure to later pay and/or quit as agreed will likely still be grounds for the landlord to begin an eviction action at court.  \nRemember the landlord is not obligated to make any such agreement, however they may see it as a more practical resolution than having to actually evict you.  \nIf you decide to pay the rent that is due, it is recommended that you call the landlord \nor the landlord\u2019s agent immediately. Tell the landlord or landlord's agent that you intend to pay the amount demanded in the notice (if it is correct) and arrange for a time and \nlocation where you can deliver the payment to the landlord or agent. You must pay the rent by the end of the third day . You should pay the unpaid rent by cashier\u2019s check, \nmoney order, or cash (if allowed by the rental agreement). Whatever the for m of \npayment, be sure to get a receipt signed by the landlord or agent that shows the date and the amount of the payment. If the landlord does not answer your call, you still only have three days to mail or deliver the payment to the address listed in the notice.  \nWith some exceptions provided by state law, the landlord cannot require that you pay \nthe unpaid rent in cash or by electronic funds transfer without offering other options. (See page 38 ). \nIf the amount of rent demanded is not correct, it is recommended that you discuss this \nwith the landlord or landlord's agent immediately and offer to pay the amount that is \nactually due. Make this offer orally and in writing and keep a copy of the written offer. The landlord\u2019s notice is not legally effective if it demands more rent than is actually due, \nor if it includes any charges other than for past -due rent (for example, late charges, \nunpaid utility charges, dishonored check fees, or interest).\n390  \nIf the amount of rent demanded is correct and does not include any other \nimpermissible charges, and if you decide not to pay, then you must move out or remain \nin your rental unit and defend against the eviction lawsuit.  \nIf you stay beyond the three court days without paying the rent that is properly due, \nyou will be occupying the rental unit unlawfully. The landlord then has a single, powerful \nremedy: a court action (called an \u201cunlawful detainer [eviction] lawsuit\u201d [see page 90 ]) to \nevict you and obtain a judgment for the unpaid rent, and possibly other amounts, such \nas court costs, attorney\u2019s fees and \u201choldover\u201d rent damages.  \nIf the three -day notice is based on something other than failure to pay rent, the notice \nwill state whether you can correct the problem and remain in the rental unit (see page \n86). If the problem can be corrected and you want to stay in the rental unit, you must \ncorrect the problem by the end of the third court day. You should retain records \nsubstantiating the repairs or corrections for your records. Once you have corrected the problem, you should promptly notify the landlord or the property manager.  \n88  If you believe that the landlord has acted unlawfully in giving you a three -day notice, \nor that you have a valid defense to an unlawful detainer lawsuit, you should consult with \na lawyer, legal aid organization, tenant -landlord program, or housing clinic (see \u201cGetting \nHelp From a Third Party,\u201d pages 105- 106). \nHow to count the three days \nFor 3 -day notices with an opportunity to cure, begin counting the three days on the \nfirst day that is not a weekend or court holiday after the day the notice was served. Continue counting all days that are not weekends or court holidays and stop on the third day. That is the day by which you must pay unpaid rent in a notice to pay or quit or cure \nthe violation in a notice to cure or quit. For example,  if the notice is served on the Friday \nbefore Labor Day, do not count Saturday, Sunday or Monday because these days are \nweekends or court holidays. D ay one will be Tuesday, day two will be Wednesday and \nday three will be Thursday.\n391 For non -curable 3- day notices the counting is different. \nDay one is the day following the service, no matter if that day is a weekend or a court \nholiday. Only if the third day falls on a weekend or court holiday will you get until the \nnext day that is not a weekend or court holiday to quit (see the next section for a \ndiscussion of service of the notice and the beginning of the notice period).392 \nPROPER SERVICE OF TERMINATION NOTICES  \nA landlord\u2019s three- day, 30- day, 60- day, or 90- day notice to a tenant must be \u201cserved\u201d \nproperly to be legally effective. The terms \u201c serve \u201d and \u201c service\u201d refer to procedures \nrequired by the law to give a tenant notice that the landlord seeks to end their tenancy \nand recover possession of the rental unit. These procedures are designed to increase the likelihood that the person to whom notice is given actually receives the notice.  \nA landlord can serve a three -day eviction notice on the tenant in one of three ways: by  \npersonal service, by substituted service, or by posting and mailing. The landlord, the landlord\u2019s agent, or anyone over 18 can serve a notice on a tenant.  \n\u2022 Personal service \u2014To serve you personally, the person serving the notice must \nhand you the notice (or leave it with you if you refuse to take it).393 \n\u2022 Substituted service on another person\u2014 If the landlord cannot find you at home, \nthe landlord should try to serve you personally at work. If the landlord cannot find you at home or at work, the landlord can use \u201csubstituted service\u201d instead of serving you  personally.\n \nTo comply with the rules on substituted service, the person serving the notice must leave the notice with a person of \u201csuitable age and di scretion\u201d at your home or work \nand also mail a copy of the notice to you at home.\n394 A person of suitable age and \ndiscretion normally would be an adult at your home or workplace, or a teenage member of your household.\n \nService of the notice is legally complete when both of these steps have been \ncompleted. The three- day period begins no sooner than the day after both steps \nhave been completed, but it could begin several days later (see \u201cHow to count the three days\u201d above).  \n\u2022 Posting and mailing\u2014 If the landlord cannot serve the notice to you personally or \nby substituted service, the notice can be served by taping or tacking a copy to the rental unit in a conspicuous place (such as the front door of the rental unit) and by \n89  mailing another copy to you at the rental unit\u2019s address.395 This service method is \ncommonly called \u201cposting and mailing\u201d or \u201cnailing and mailing.\u201d  \nService of the notice is not complete until both the notice has been posted and the \ncopy of the notice has been mailed. The three- day period begins on the later of the \nday on which the notice was posted or mailed,  but it could begin several days later \n(see \u201cHow to count the three days\u201d above).396 \nA landlord can use any of these methods to serve a 30 -day, 60- day or 90-day notice \nto terminate a tenancy on a tenant, or they can send the notice to the tenant by certified or registered mai l with return receipt requested.\n397 For these notices, the timeframes \nbegin on the day when service is made and continue for the number of days stated in the notice. If the last day falls on a weekend or court holiday, that deadline rolls over to the next day that is not a weekend or court holiday.  \nTHE EVICTION PROCESS (UNLAWFUL DETAINER LAWSUIT) \nCOVID -19 EVICTION MORATORIUM: On February 9, 2022, the Governor signed \ninto law SB 115 to extend the availability of financial assistance provided by the Tenant Relief Act to protect  tenants and landlords impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. For \ntenants who were unable to pay their rent between March 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 due to financial distress arising from or related to COVID -19, the Act provided \na moratorium on evictions during that time period provided the tenants timely returned to their landlords a signed declaration of COVID -19-Related Financial Distress.\n398 For \ntenants and landlords, the Act provided financial assistance for unpaid rent and utilities from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022.\n399  \nAlthough the Tenant Relief Act influences discussions in this chapter, this chapter is \nwritten with a focus on the law governing tenancy terminations and tenant evictions occurring before March 1, 2020 and after September 30, 2021.  \nOverview of the eviction process  \nIf the tenant does not voluntarily move out after the landlord has properly given the \nrequired notice to the tenant, the landlord can begin the court eviction process. In order \nto evict the tenant, the landlord must file an unlawful detainer lawsuit in Superior Court in the county where the rental unit is located and then properly serve you with a summons \nand a copy of the unlawful detainer complaint. In general, proper service requires that \nsomeone personally han d you the summons and complaint.\n400 There are circumstances \nwhere they can be handed to someone else, but in that instance you will be given more \ndays in which to respond.401 In certain instances a court may allow a landlord to serve \nyou by posting copies at the rental unit and mailing copies to you via certified mail.402 \nIn an eviction lawsuit, the landlord is called the \u201cplaintiff \u201d, and the tenant is called the \n\u201cdefendant.\u201d  \nLaws designed to stop drug dealing403 and unlawful use, manufacture, or possession of \nweapons and ammunition,404 permit a city attorney or prosecutor in selected jurisdictions405 to file \nan unlawful detainer action against a tenant based on an arrest report (or other action or report by law enforcement or regulatory agencies) if the landlord fails to evict the tenant after 30 days' notice from the city. The tenant must be notified of the nature of the action and possible \ndefenses.  \n90  An unlawful detainer lawsuit is a \u201csummary\u201d court procedure. This means that the \ncourt action moves forward very quickly, and that the time given the tenant to respond \nduring the lawsuit is very short. For example, in most unlawful detainer cases, the tenant has only five court days (i.e., days that are not Saturdays, Sundays, or judicial holidays) \nto file a written response to the lawsuit after being properly served with a copy of the landlord\u2019s summons and complaint.\n406 Normally, a date for a trial in front of a judge or \njury will be set within 20 days after the tenant or the landlord files a request to set the \ncase for trial.407 \u202fThese time periods are substantially shorter than the time periods for \nnon-summary cases. Given the expedited treatment given to summary court \nprocedures, should you seek assistance from someone knowledgeable in landlord/tenant law, you should not delay seeking guidance from an attorney, legal aid \norganization, or tenant advocacy group because your written response (e.g. an Answer) must be filed within five days of the date that you were served unless the fifth day is a \nweekend or court holiday, in which case the answer must be filed on the next day that is not a weekend or court holiday. Note that obtaining a jury trial requires additional steps and, as  with any trial, it is highly recommended a tenant retain legal representation \nespecially if the case will be tried to a  jury. \nThe court -administered eviction process assures the tenant of the right to a trial if the \ntenant believes that the landlord has no right to evict the tenant. The landlord must use \nthis court process to evict the tenant; the landlord cannot use self -help measures to \nforce the tenant to move. For example, the landlord cannot physically remove or lock out the tenant, cut off utilities such as water, gas or electricity, remove outside windows \nor doors, or seize (remove) the tenant\u2019s belongings in order to carry  out the eviction. The \nlandlord must use the court procedures . \nIf the landlord uses unlawful methods to evict a tenant, the landlord may be subject to \nliability for the tenant\u2019s actual damages, such as needing to stay in hotel, additional cost \nof paying to eat away from home, etc., as well as penalties of up to $100 per day for the \ntime that the landlord used the unlawful methods.\n408\u202f \nIn an unlawful detainer lawsuit, the court holds a trial where the parties can present \ntheir evidence and explain their case. If the court decides in favor of the tenant, the \ntenant will not have to move out (but may still be liable for unpaid rent), and the landlord \nmay be ordered to pay court costs (for example, the tenant\u2019s filing fees). If the tenant\u2019s \ndefense involves alleging the landlord failed to provide a habitable premises, which justified their non- payment of rent, the court may order the landlord to make repairs. \nThe landlord also may have to pay the tenant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, if the rental agreement contains an attorney\u2019s fee clause and if the tenant was represented by an attorney.\n409 \nIf the court decides in favor of the landlord, the court will issue a writ of \npossession.410 The writ of possession orders the sheriff to remove the tenant from the \nrental unit but  gives the tenant five days from the date that the writ is served to  leave \nvoluntarily. If the tenant does not leave by the end of the fifth day, the writ of possession \nauthorizes the sheriff to physically remove and lock the tenant out. When a tenant is \nlocked out, if the tenant leaves behind personal property, the tenant\u2019s personal property \nmust be processed in accordance with California law, specifically Civil Code section 1951.3. The landlord is not entitled to possession of the rental unit until after the sheriff \nhas removed the tenant . \nThe court also may award the landlord any unpaid rent if the eviction is based on the \n91  tenant\u2019s failure to pay rent. The court can also award additional rent damages (so -called \n\u201choldover damages\u201d) for days of rent, for which the landlord would not otherwise be paid, \nfor the time the tenant has remained in the unit up to the day the court\u2019s judgment is entered. The court also may award the landlord court costs, and attorney\u2019s fees (if the rental agreement contains an attorney\u2019s fee clause and if the landlord was represented by an attorney). If the court finds that the tenant acted maliciously in not giving up the rental unit, the court also may award the landlord up to an additional $600 as a \npenalty.\n411 The judgm ent against the tenant will be reported on the tenant\u2019s credit report \nfor seven years.412 \u202fAny amount of money awarded to the landlord may be garnished \nfrom the tenant\u2019s wages, the tenant\u2019s bank account, and/or by other judgment \nenforcement means.  \nHow to respond to an unlawful detainer lawsuit  \nIf you , a tenant,  are served with an unlawful detainer complaint, you should get legal \nadvice or assistance immediately because unlawful detainer actions are summary \nproceedings and have shortened deadlines. Tenant organizations, tenant -landlord \nprograms, housing clinics, legal aid organizations, or private attorneys can provide you \nwith advice, and assistance if you need it (see \u201cGetting Help From a Third Party,\u201d pages \n105-106). Keep in mind that only licensed attorneys can give you legal advice, but other \norganizations can help with the process of responding to an unlawful detainer. Many courts also have \u201cself -help\u201d centers where you can get access to resources and \nassistance to help you respond. Again, these centers cannot provide legal advice, but they can help you navigate the process.  \nAs a tenant, you  usually  have only five court days to respond in writing to the \nlandlord\u2019 s complaint.\n413 You must respond during this time by filing the correct legal \ndocument with the Clerk of Court in which the lawsuit was filed. Typically, a tenant \nresponds to a landlord\u2019s complaint by filing a written \u201canswer\u201d (you can get a copy of a \nform to use for  filing an answer from the Clerk of Court\u2019s office or online at \nwww.courts.ca.gov/documents/ud105.pdf ). There is a substantial filing fee for each \ndefendant submitting an answer. However, if you are very low income or paying the fee \nwould be a hardship you can file additional forms to ask that the fee be waived (these forms are available from the court or  online at \nhttps://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm?query=fee%20waivers ) at the same time you file \nyour answer.  \nAs a tenant, you may have a legal defense or defenses to the landlord\u2019s complaint. If \nso, you must state the defense(s) in a written answer and file your written answer with \nthe Clerk of Court by the end of the fifth court day following the day you were properly served the summons and complaint. Otherwise, the landlord can ask the court for a \n\u2018default judgment\u2019 because you failed to answer, and you may lose any chance to state any defenses that you may have. Some typical defenses that a tenant might have ar e \nlisted here as examples:  \n\u2022 The landlord\u2019s three- day notice requested more rent than was actually  due. \n\u2022 The rental unit violated the implied warranty of habitability by failing to provide safe \nand habitable conditions at the property.  \n\u2022 The landlord filed the eviction action in retaliation for the tenant exercising a tenant \nright or because the tenant complained to the building inspector about the condition \n92  of the rental  unit. \n\u2022 The landlord filed the eviction action because an act of domestic violence, sexual \nassault, stalking, elder abuse or human trafficking that disturbed the other tenants, \nbut the victim has not allowed the perpetrator to return to the  unit. \n\u2022 The landlord filed the eviction because police or emergency assistance were called \nby or on behalf of a victim of crime, victim of abuse, or person in an emergency where assistance was believed to be necessary. \nThe answer form has check boxes that allow you to select \u201caffirmative defenses\u201d that \nyou believe apply to your case. You then should provide in the answer an explanation of the facts that support any selected defense(s). You may also attach relevant documents to answer as \u201cExhibits\u201d that help state and/or prove the facts you are relying upon.  \nDepending on the facts of your case, there are other legal responses to the landlord\u2019s \ncomplaint that you might file instead of an answer. For example, if you believe that your landlord did not properly serve the summons and the complaint, you might file a Motion \nto Quash Service of Summons . If you believe that the complaint has some technical \ndefect or does not properly allege the landlord\u2019s right to evict you, you might file a document called a \" demurrer \" requesting dismissal of the complaint. You might also file \na Motion to Strike to ask the court to invalidate some portion, or even all, of the landlord\u2019s complaint. It is strongly recommended that you obtain advice from a lawyer before you attempt to use these procedures . It is also recommended that you obtain \nadvice from a lawyer before you file your answer. However, keep in mind that you do not want to miss the deadline, so seek legal assistance the same day you are served an unlawful detainer complaint. \nIn addition to filing any form of response to the landlord\u2019s summons and complaint you \nmust properly serve a copy of that response to the landlord, or more likely to the attorney who represents the landlord. Most often this is done by mail. However, you, as a party to the case, are not permitted to be the one carrying out that service. You must get an adult (i.e., someone who is over the age of 18) who is not a party to the case to perform the \nservice and sign a \u201cproof of service\u201d form that you will file with the court.  \nIf you do not file a written response to the landlord\u2019s complaint by the end of the fifth \nday, assuming that the landlord properly served the summons and complaint, the court \nmay approve the landlord\u2019s request to enter a default judgment in favor of the landlord \nafter the landlord submits a request to the court to enter a default against you. A default \njudgment allows the landlord to obtain a writ of possession (see page 100) and may also \nlead to an award to the landlord for unpaid rent, damages and court costs. A default \njudgment means that you lose the case and will be evicted. \nThe Clerk of Court will ask you to pay a filing fee for each answering defendant \nnamed in the landlord\u2019s complaint when they file a written response. As of January 1, \n2024, the filing fee typically is about $370 per answering defendan t, but it may be  waived \nbased on income or hardship (see discussion on page 93).\n414 \nAfter you file your written answer  to the landlord\u2019s complaint and  serve a copy of that \nanswer to the landlord or their attorney, the landlord will submit a request to the court for \na trial date for the case called a \u201cRequest to Set Case for Trial\u201d (form UD -150). The \nlandlord is supposed to also mail you a copy of this request, however that often does not \n93  happen. You can also file the same form as a \u201cCounter Request to Set Case for Trial.\u201d \nOnce the court clerk has received the landlord\u2019s request, and possibly your counter \nrequest, they will mail to both you and the landlord a notice of the time and place of  the \ntrial. If you fail to appear in court, the trial may occur without your presence, which will mean you will have no ability to contradict any evidence or testimony presented by your landlord.  \nService of tenant\u2019s written answer  \nYou must also serve your landlord (or the landlord\u2019s attorney, if the landlord is \nrepresented by legal counsel) with a copy of the written answer to the landlord\u2019s complaint. This must be done by someone over the age of 18 who is not a party to the \ncase. Service is usually completed by mailing or personally serving a copy of the \nwritten answer on/to the landlord (or the landlord\u2019s attorney, if the landlord is represented). The person who completes this service should then fill out and sign a Proof of Servic e. The tenant should file the Proof of Service,  along with his/her answer, \nwith the Clerk of the Court.  \nSpecial Rules for Tenants in the Military  \nA servicemember may be entitled to a stay (delay) of an eviction action for 90 days. \nThis rule applies to the servicemember and his or her dependents (such as a spouse or child) in a residential rental unit with rent of  $2,400 per month or less, as adjusted by the \nhousing price inflation adjustment beginning in 2004. In 2018, the rental ceiling was $3,717. The servicemember\u2019s ability to pay rent must be materially affected by military service. The judge may order the stay  on his or her own motion or upon re quest by the \nservicemember or a representative. The judge can adjust the length and terms of the delay as equity (fairness) requires.\n415 \nLandlords that violate the court -ordered eviction process in regard to a \nservicemember may face a fine and/or imprisonment for up to one year.416 \nEviction of \u201cunnamed occupants\u201d  \nSometimes, adults who are not parties to the rental agreement move into the rental \nunit with the tenant or after the tenant leaves, but before the unlawful detainer lawsuit is filed. When a landlord thinks that these \u201coccupants\u201d might claim a legal right to possess the rental unit, the landlord may seek to include them as defendants in the eviction action, even if the landlord does not know who they are. In this case, the landlord will serve the tenant and \u201call other occupants\u201d with a Prejudgment Claim of R ight to \nPossession at the same time that the eviction summ ons and complaint are served on \nthe tenants who are named defendants.\n417 Note that when service includes this form it \nmay only be performed by a marshal, sheriff, or a process served registered with the state. See additional discussion of \u201cunnamed occupants\u201d and the Claim of Right to  \nPossession on page 95. Unnamed occupants should consider whether it is prudent to \ncomplete and submit the Prejudgment Claim form, which effectively adds their name as a defendant in the eviction lawsuit. While being a defendant may allow a person to state their own defense it may come at the price of having a record of a court eviction.  \nHowever, without making such a submission, the unnamed occupants\u2019 fate with respect to being evicted will depend on what happens to those already named in the lawsuit. If those tenants lose at court the sheriff will evict everyone at the unit, as the oppor tunity to \n94  submit a (post -judgment) Claim of Right to Possession is foreclosed by the service of the \nPrejudgment Claim form.  \nBefore the court hearing \nBefore appearing in court, if you are not able to be represented by an attorney, you \nmust carefully prepare your case, just as an attorney would. If you elect to retain an \nattorney, you should try to find an attorney as early as possible. Among other things, you should:  \n\u2022 Be mindful that when you are served with the summons and complaint, you \nhave only five court days after you have been properly served the summons \nand complaint in which to file an answer. You should carefully read the summons,  which  contains very specific information on how to answer the \ncomplaint and the strict timelines. (Please refer to page 92) \n\u2022 Talk with a housing clinic, tenant organization, attorney, or legal aid organization as \nearly as possible. This will help you understand the legal issues in your case and the \nevidence that you will  need.  \n\u2022 Request discovery of the evidence that may be helpful to your case or to preparing \na defense (see \u201cDiscovery in Unlawful Detainer Cases\u201d page  98). \n\u2022 Decide how you will present the facts that support your side of the case. What \ndocuments, letters, photographs or videos will you attempt to offer into evidence? \nWhat witnesses do you intend to call to testify on your  behalf.  \n\u2022 Have at least five copies of all documents that you intend to use as evidence\u2014an \noriginal for the judge and copies for the court clerk, the opposing party, your \nwitnesses and you. \n\u2022 Ask witnesses who will help your case to testify at the trial. You can subpoena a \nwitness who will not testify voluntarily. A subpoena is an order from the court \ncompelling a witness to appear. The subpoena must be served upon (handed to) the witness within a reasonable time before the hearing (for example, two weeks prior to \nthe hearing), and can be served by anyone, other than yourself, who is over the age \nof 18. You can obtain a subpoena from the Clerk of Court. You must pay witness fees at the time the subpoena is served on the witness, if the witness requests  them.  \nThe parties to an unlawful detainer lawsuit have the right to a jury trial, and either \nparty can request one.\n418 After you have filed your answer to the landlord\u2019s complaint, \nusually the landlord will file a document called a Memorandum to Set Case for Trial \n(officially called a \u201cRequest/Counter -Request to Set Case for Trial - Unlawful Detainer\u201d \nform [Judicial Council Form UD -150].)419 You can get a copy online at \nwww.courts.ca.gov/documents/ud150.pdf. This document will indicate whether the \nplaintiff (landlord) has requested a jury trial. Whether or not you should request a jury \ntrial will depend on the individual facts and circumstances of your case. Jury trials may  \nbe more beneficial under certain circumstances and less beneficial under other \ncircumstances. However, you may want to list in your answer that you request a jury \ntrial, and you can later decide to waive your right to a jury, if you so choose. But if you do not request a jury timely, then later you will not have the right to a  jury. \nThere are several good reasons for this recommendation. First, presenting a case to a \njury is more complex than presenting a case to a judge, and a non- lawyer representing \n95  himself or herself may find it very difficult. Second, the party requesting a jury trial will be \nresponsible for depositing the initial cost of jury fees with the court, unless a \nsupplemental fee waiver request is granted. Third, the losing party will have to pay all of  \nthe jury costs.420 \nAt any time prior to entry of final judgment, either party may initiate settlement \ndiscussions to resolve the parties\u2019 dispute. There are a number of reasons why landlords and/or tenants may find settlement preferable to proceeding through trial, including if any \nparty has doubts about the merits of their case, the prospect that a material witness may \nnot testify or testify adversely against their case, and/or concerns about the litigation \ncosts and time associated with preparing and trying their case to conclusion before a judge or jury.  \nIf the parties reach a settlement, the settlement typically is made official by a \ndocument called a \u201cstipulated judgment.\u201d The agreement may be that the tenant pays \nthe landlord a certain amount, possibly in installments instead of one lump sum, the \ntenant  agrees to move out by a certain date, or the landlord agrees to make certain \nrepairs. It is very important that both parties fully understand all provisions of any  \nsettlement before signing the stipulation , which then will be presented to the judge. \nDo not let yourself be rushed into agreeing to a stipulation without understanding it and make sure that you can keep the promises that you are agreeing to.  \nIf at all possible, as part of the negotiation in arriving at the settlement, the defendant \n(i.e., the tenant if the landlord filed the lawsuit or the landlord if the tenant filed the lawsuit) should demand that in exchange for the defendant\u2019s promised actions the plaintiff will agree to dismiss the case. Be aware that such settlements typically are structured so that if a party fails to do any one of the things he/she agreed to (a default) \nthe non -defaulting party will immediately have the right to enter a  judgment against the \ndefaulting party and receive certain relief as part of that judgment. If the tenant is the defaulting party, that may lead to the landlord obtaining an immediate issuance of a writ of possession to remove the tenant from the rental unit. However, if the defendant performs as agreed, and the agreement calls for it, the plaintiff will dismiss the case and there will be no adverse judgment against the defendant.  \n \n96   \nDiscovery in Unlawful Detainer Cases  \n \nParties to a lawsuit, including an unlawful detainer (eviction) lawsuit are entitled to \nconduct discovery to learn about another party\u2019s facts, defenses or the bases for their \nlegal positions. Any party may avail him/herself of any one or all four of the available \ndiscovery vehicles, which consist of written interrogatories,421 reques ts for production of \ndocuments,422 requests for admissions,423 and depositions424 of another party to the \nlawsuit or third parties not involved in the lawsuit. Interrogatories are written questions \nthat the responding party must answer under oath. R equests for production seek to obtain \ncopies of the responding party\u2019s documents. Requests for admissions seek to have the \nresponding party admit or deny the truthfulness of a particular statement.  Depositions are \nlive, in -person opportunities for one party to ask another party or a third- party questions \nthat that party must answer under oath. Each of the four available discovery vehicles requires a minimum of five days\u2019 notice to the other party before that party is required to respond.\n425 This timeline applies if the discovery requests are personally delivered either \nto the office of the other party or the office of his/her attorney if they are represented. The \nresponding party is afforded an additional 5 days (10 days total) if service is performed by \nmail. Under these rules, the responding party must comply with the requesting party\u2019s request  for discovery within five days.\n426 All discovery must be completed on or before \nthe fifth day before the date set for trial .427 Because the landlord can request the court \nto set a trial date as soon as an answer is filed, it is imperative that any discovery action is commenced within a few days of filing and serving the answer, or even before that occurs.  \n\u2022 If the tenant intends to defend his or her case and intends to use the discovery process \nas a tool, the tenant must follow strict timelines applicable to evictions in California.  \n\u2022 The discovery process works in five- day increments. Once the landlord serves the \ntenant with the unlawful detainer complaint, the tenant may begin discovery by \npersonally serving or mailing any discovery requests. The responding party must respond within f ive days of the date that they received it if personally served or \nwithin ten days of the date that they received it if mailed. All of the discovery  must  \nbe completed at least five days before the date of the trial.\n428 \n \n \n   \n \n97  After the court\u2019s decision \nIf the court decides in favor of the tenant, the tenant will not have to move out, and the \nlandlord may be ordered to pay the tenant\u2019s court costs (for example, filing fees) and the \ntenant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees if that is a provision of the rental agreement and the tenant was represented by an attorney at trial. However, the tenant may have to pay any rent that \nthe court orders within 5 days, which if not paid within that timeframe could result in the \ncourt issuing a judgment in favor of the landlord instead.\n429 If the tenant\u2019s defense to the \nlandlord\u2019s unlawful detainer action was based on a breach of the warranty of habitability \nthe rent to be paid will likely be reduced from that called for by the rental agreement. The court may order a continued reduction in rent until certain necessary repairs are made. \nIf the landlord wins, the tenant will have to move out. In some circumstances, the \ncourt may order the tenant to pay the landlord\u2019s court costs and attorney\u2019s fees if the landlord was represented by an attorney at trial and the rental agreement contains an  \nattorneys\u2019 fees clause. The court also may order the tenant to pay rent during the holdover period (i.e., the period of time between the end of the rental term and the date of trial).  \nThe court has discretion to stay the execution of any judgment.\n430 A losing tenant can \nrequest the court to exercise that discretion to delay when they will have to move out.  \nThat request would typically be made through an \u2018ex parte\u2019 application, before the trial judge, for more time to surrender the premises due to hardship or other good cause. Proper notice of this \u2018ex parte\u2019 application needs to be provided to the landlord or the landlord\u2019s attorney, and the hearing needs to happen quickly, and prior to the sheriff\u2019s \nlockout . The sheriff will post a 5- day notice to vacate the property before the lockout \ncan occur (see Writ of Possession, page 100 ). \nThe application to stay the execution of the Court\u2019s  judgment should be supported by \nthe tenant\u2019s written declaration (i.e., a statement by the tenant made under penalty of \nperjury) that states detailed facts regarding the hardship or other good cause. If the court agrees to stay the execution of the judgement it will condition it on payment of rent for \nthe period of the stay, but not upon paying any past due rent. The extra time likely will be \nlimited, as the judge might deem equitable, perhaps as little as a week or up to a month. Most likely this type of stay would not be granted for any period past 10 days after  the \ntime limit to appeal the judgment, which could be around 40 days.\n431 For any further stay \nit would be necessary to seek or already have sought a stay pending appeal pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1176, further discussed below.  \nIt is possible, but very rare, for a losing tenant to convince the court to allow the tenant \nto remain in the rental unit. This is called relief from forfeiture of the tenancy. The \ntenant must convince the court of two things in order to obtain relief from forfeiture: (1) that the eviction would cause the tenant severe hardship, and (2) either that the tenant is able to pay all  of the rent that is due or that the tenant wi ll fully comply with the rental \nagreement.\n432 \nA tenant can obtain relief from forfeiture even if the tenancy has terminated (ended), \nso long as possession of the unit has not been turned over to the landlord. A tenant \nseeking relief from forfeiture must apply for relief at any time prior to restoration of the \npremises to the landlord, but such a petition should be made as soon as possible after the court issues its judgment in the unlawful detainer lawsuit. To do this, the tenant must \n98  file a mo tion for relief from forfeiture.433 A tenant who is not represented by an attorney \nat trial can even make an oral motion for relief from forfeiture immediately following the \ncourt\u2019s decision or by speaking with the judge in an \u2018 ex parte\u2019 hearing. \nA tenant who loses an unlawful detainer lawsuit may appeal the judgment if the \ntenant believes that the judge mistakenly decided a legal issue in the case. However, the \ntenant will have to move out of the rental unit before the appeal is decided by the court, unless the tenant petitions for a stay of enforcement of the judgment or applies for relief from forfeiture (described immediately above). The court will not grant the tenant\u2019s \nrequest for a stay of enforcement unless the court finds that the tenant or  the tenant\u2019s \nfamily will suffer extreme hardship, and that the landlord will not suffer irreparable harm. \nIf the court grants the request for a stay of enforcement, it will order the tenant to make rent payments to the court in the amount ordered by the c ourt and may  impose additional \nconditions.\n434 \nA landlord who loses an unlawful detainer lawsuit also may appeal the judgment as \nwell. \nWrit of possession  \nIf a judgment is entered against the tenant and becomes final (for example, if the \ntenant does not appeal or loses on appeal), and the tenant does not move out, the court \nwill issue a writ of possession to the landlord.435 The landlord can deliver this legal \ndocument to the sheriff, who will then forcibly evict the tenant from the rental unit if the tenant does not leave within the time allowed.  \nBefore evicting the tenant, the sheriff will serve the tenant with a copy of the writ of \npossession along with a notice to vacate .\n436 If the tenant is not at home, the sheriff may \npost it on the tenant\u2019s door. The writ of possession instructs the tenant that he/she must \nmove out by the end of the fifth day after the writ is served, and that if the tenant does not move out, the sheriff will remove the tenant from the rental unit and place the  \nlandlord back in possession.\n437 The cost of serving the writ of possession will be added \nto the other costs of the suit that the landlord can collect from the tenant.  \nAfter the tenant is served with the writ of possession, they five days to move. If the \ntenant has not moved by the end of the fifth day, the sheriff will return and physically \nremove the tenant.438 If a tenant\u2019s belongings are still in the rental unit, they will initially \nbe locked in. The landlord must exercise reasonable care of your belongings and store them in a place of safekeeping. The landlord has the option of continuing to store your \nbelongings in the unit or removing them to another storage space for safekeeping. The landlord cannot unreasonably deny you the r ight to reclaim your belongings.\n439 \nHowever, before the tenant can reclaim his/her belongings the landlord may require the \ntenant to pay for the reasonable storage costs and moving costs, if any. If they are \nstored in the rental unit the landlord can ask the tenant to pay the reasonable daily \nrental value for the unit for each day they are stored. If the tenant does not reclaim \nthese belongings within 15 days, the landlord can mail the tenant a notice to pick them \nup, and t hen can either sell them at auction or keep them (if their value is less than \n$700).440 If the sheriff forcibly evicts you, the sheriff\u2019s cost will also be added to the \njudgment, which the landlord can collect from you, e.g. through wage garnishment, \nbank garnishment, or other judgment enforcement means. \n \n99  Stay of Execution  \nIf you are a tenant served with a writ of possession, you may be able to file something \ncalled a Stay of Execution to stay in your home for a short while longer. A Stay of \nExecution asks the court to delay the eviction for a certain period of time not longer than 40 days. In return, you must pay rent to the court for each extra day that you remain once the Stay is granted. A Stay does not change the eviction judgment or reinstate your tenancy, but it can grant you more time to file a motion seeking to do so . Different courts \nmay use different procedures for requesting a Stay, but each one will require you to notify your landlord and file a written  request.\n441 \nSetting aside or vacating a default judgment or trial judgment  \nIf the tenant does not file a written response to the landlord\u2019s complaint, the landlord \ncan ask the court to enter a default judgment against the tenant. Upon the court entering \ndefault, the tenant will receive a notice of judgment, and a writ of possession as described above.  \nThere are many reasons why a tenant might not respond to the landlord\u2019s complaint. \nFor example, the tenant may have received the summons and complaint, but was not able to respond because the tenant was ill or incapacitated, or for some other very good \nreason. There are also circumstances where the landlord failed properly to serve the \ntenant with the summons and complaint, hence the reason why the tenant may have been unaware of the legal proceeding or the need to appear at trial. In situations such as  \nthese, where the tenant has a valid reason for not responding to the landlord\u2019s complaint, the tenant can ask the court to set aside the default judgment.  \nSetting aside or \u201cvacating\u201d a judgment can be a complex legal proceeding, so be sure \nto retain an attorney as early as possible if you plan on having an attorney represent you \nin your efforts to set aside or vacate a judgment. Common reasons for seeking to set \naside a default judgment are the tenant\u2019s (or the tenant\u2019s lawyer\u2019s) mistake, \ninadvertence,  surprise, or excusable neglect.\n442 A tenant who wants to ask the court to \nset aside a judgment must act promptly. The tenant should be able to show the court that they have a satisfactory excuse for not filing a response or missing the trial, acted \npromptly in making the request, and had a good chance to win at trial.\n443\u202fThis last item is \ncrucial, and is achieved by submitting a \u2018proposed answer\u2019 that states a seemingly plausible affirmative defense to the eviction, along with the other required documents \nwhen requesting a default be set aside. If possession of the unit has been returned to the landlord (i.e. the tenant has been locked out) the tenant can still seek to set aside \nthe default, but it may not result in the tenant being restored to the  unit. \nSpecial rules for tenants in the military may make it more difficult for a landlord to \nobtain a default judgment against the tenant and may make it possible f or a tenant to \nreopen a default judgment and defend the unlawful detainer action.\n444 \nA word about bankruptcy \nSome tenants think that filing a bankruptcy petition will prevent them from being \nevicted. This is not always true. Even if it delays an eviction, filing for bankruptcy without \nhaving a legitimate need for other economic relief is generally a poor idea.  \nFiling for  bankruptcy is a serious decision with many long- term consequences beyond \nthe eviction action.  \n100  A tenant who is thinking about filing bankruptcy because of the threat of eviction, or \nfor any reason, should consult a bankruptcy attorney and carefully weigh their advice. \nWhile it is possible for a person to file for bankruptcy without the use of an att orney\u2019s \nservices, it is ill- advised at best.  \nBankruptcy, which is handled in the federal bankruptcy courts, is a complicated legal \nspecialty and explaining it is beyond the scope of this guide. However, here is some \nbasic information about bankruptcy as it relates to unlawful detainer proceedings:445 \n\u2022 A tenant who files a bankruptcy petition normally is entitled to an  immediate \nautomatic stay (delay) of a pending unlawful detainer action. If the landlord hasn\u2019t  \nalready filed the unlawful detainer action, the automatic stay prevents the landlord \nfrom taking steps such as serving a three -day notice or filing the  action.446 \n\u2022 The landlord may petition the bankruptcy court for permission to proceed with the \nunlawful detainer action (called \u201crelief from the automatic  stay\u201d).447 \n\u2022 The automatic stay may continue in effect until the bankruptcy case is closed, \ndismissed, or completed. On the other hand, the bank ruptcy court  may lift the stay  if \nthe landlord shows t hat they are entitled to relief.448 It is fairly routine for the \nbankruptcy court to grant the landlord\u2019s petition, resulting in some delay of  the \neviction process, but any actual prevention of the eviction proceeding.  \n\u2022 The automatic stay normally does not prevent the landlord from enforcing an \nunlawful detainer judgment that was obtained before the tenant\u2019s petition was filed. \nIn some cases, however, the tenan t may be able to keep the stay in effect for 30 \ndays after the petition is  filed.449 \n\u2022 The automatic stay does not apply if the landlord\u2019s eviction action is based on the \ntenant\u2019s endangering the rental property or using illegal controlled substances on the \nproperty, and if the landlord files a required certification with the bankruptcy cour t. \nThe stay normally will remain in e ffect, however, for 15 days after the landlord files \nthe certification with the court.450 \n\u2022 A bankruptcy case can be dismissed for \u201ccause\u201d \u2014for example, if the tenant neglects \nto pay fees or file necessary schedules and financial information, causes \nunreasonable delay that harms the landlord, or files the case in bad faith.451 \n\u2022 The bankruptcy court also can issue sanctions (i.e., penalties) against a person who \nfiles for bankruptcy petition in bad  faith.  \nA landlord may try to evict a tenant because the tenant has exercised a legal right (for \nexample, using the repair and deduct remedy, pages 52-5 3) or has complained about a \nproblem in the rental unit. Or, the landlord may raise the tenant\u2019s rent or otherwise seek \nto punish the tenant for complaining or lawfully exercising a tenant right.  \nIn these situations, the landlord\u2019s action may be considered retaliatory because the \nlandlord is punishing the tenant for the tenant\u2019s exercise of a legal right. The law offers \ntenants protection from retaliatory eviction and other retaliatory acts.452 \nIf a landlord tries to evict a tenant within six months after the tenant has exercised \ncertain rights, the law assum es the eviction is retaliatory.453 The following are examples of \nrights that the tenant may lawfully exercise:  \n101  \u2022 Using the repair and deduct remedy or telling the landlord that the tenant will use the \nrepair and deduct  remedy.  \n\u2022 Complaining about the condition of the rental unit to the landlord, or to an \nappropriate public agency (such as local code enforcement) after giving the landlord \nnotice.  \n\u2022 Filing a lawsuit or beginning arbitration based on the condition of the rental  unit. \n\u2022 Causing an appropriate public agency to inspect the rental unit or to issue a citation \nto the landlord.  \nIn order for the tenant to defend against eviction on the basis of retaliation, the tenant \nmust prove that they exercised one or more of these rights within the six -month period \nimmediately preceding the landlord\u2019s attempt to evict the tenant, that the tenant\u2019s rent is current, and that the tenant has not used the defense of retaliation more than once in the \npast 12 months. If the tenant produces all of this evidence, then the burden is on the \nlandlord to present evidence and prove that they did not have a retaliatory  motive.\n454 \nEven if the landlord proves that they have a valid reason for the eviction, the tenant may \nstill prove retaliation by showing that the landlord\u2019s effort to evict the tenant is not in good \nfaith (i.e. it is merely a pretext).455 If both sides produce the necessary evidence, the \njudge or jury then must decide whether the landlord\u2019s action was retaliatory or was based on a valid reason.  \nA tenant can also assert retaliation as a defense to eviction if the tenant has lawfully \norganized or participated in a tenants\u2019 organization or protest or has lawfully exercised \nany other legal right, such as requesting repairs that the landlord is required to make or making a complaint about the landlord to a government agency. In these circumstances, \nthe tenant must prove that they engaged in the protected ac tivity, and that the landlord\u2019s \nconduct was retaliatory.\n456 \nIn addition to citing illegal retaliation as a defense to eviction, a tenant can file an \naffirmative case seeking actual and statutory monetary damages if they believe they have been the victim of retaliation. A tenant can bring such a claim even if they m ove \ndue to a landlord\u2019s retaliatory actions. A tenant does not have to \u2018stay and fight\u2019.  \nHowever, if a tenant unsuccessfully raises retaliation as a defense in an unlawful \ndetainer, such an affirmative claim on the same or similar facts will likely be unsuccessful, as a court has already ruled that there was no retaliation. In addition to \nactual damages, the anti -retaliation law provides for up to $2,000 in statutory damages \nfor each actual or attempted retaliatory act by the landlord.  \nIf you feel that your landlord has retaliated against you because of action you properly  \ntook against your landlord, talk with an attorney or legal aid organization. An attorney also \nmay be able to advise you about other defenses. \nRetaliatory discrimination \nA landlord, managing agent, real estate broker, or salesperson violates California\u2019s \nFair Employment and Housing Act and the federal Fair Housing Act by harassing, \nevicting, or otherwise discriminating against a person in the sale or renting of housing \nwhen the \u201cdo minant purpose\u201d is to retaliate against a person who has done any of the \nfollowing:\n457 \n102  \u2022 Opposed practices that are discriminatory and unlawful under either  Act; \n\u2022 Told the police about a landlord\u2019s discriminatory or unlawful behavior;  or \n\u2022 Aided or encouraged a person to exercise rights protected by California laws \nprohibiting housing discrimination.  \nA tenant who can prove that the landlord\u2019s eviction action is based on a discriminatory \nmotive has a defense to the unlawful detainer action. A tenant who is the victim of \nretaliatory discrimination also has a cause of action for damages under the Fair Employment and Housing Act.\n458 If your landlord has been discriminating against you, \nyou can contact your local legal services office found at lawhelpca.org and/or the Department of Fair Employment and Housing at www.dfeh.ca.gov . \n \n \nRESOLVING PROBLEMS  \n \n \nTALK WITH YOUR LANDLORD  \nCommunication is the key to avoiding and resolving most problems. If you have a \nproblem with your rental unit, it is usually best to talk with your landlord before taking \nother action. Your landlord may be willing to correct the problem or to work out a solution. By the same token, the landlord (or the landlord\u2019s agent or manager) should \ndiscuss problems with the tenant before taking legal action. The tenant may be willing to correct the problem once they understand the landlord\u2019s concerns. Both parties should remember that each has the duty to deal with the other fairly and in good faith (see page \n28). While communication might be effective by  talking, it some instances it may not be \npossible, or it just be better to communicate in writing, especially if there is a need to \ndocument the content of the communication. \nIf discussions with the landlord does not solve the problem, and if the problem is the \nlandlord\u2019s responsibility (see pages 47 -51), you should write to the landlord. Your written \ncommunication should describe the problem, its effect on you, how long the problem has existed, what you may have done to remedy the problem or limit its effect (although the \nlaw does not require a tenant to correct an inhabitable unit), and what action you would \nlike the landlord to take. You should always keep a copy of your written communication.  \nIf you have been dealing with an agent of the landlord, such as a property manager, \nyou may want to directly contact the owner of the rental unit if you know or can learn the owner\u2019s identity. The name, address and telephone number of the owner, the proper ty \nmanager, or another person authorized to act on the owner\u2019s behalf with respect to notices to be given/received and service of process  must be written in your rental \nagreement or posted conspicuously in the building.\n459 \nIf you do not hear from the landlord after sending the letter or e -mail, or if the landlord \ndisagrees with your complaint, you may need to use one of the tenant remedies that are discussed in this guide or  obtain legal assistance. The length of time that you should \nwait for the landlord to act depends on the seriousness of the problem. Normally, 30 days is presumed to be a reasonable time for the landlord to act unless the nature of the problem dictates otherwise (i.e. heater not working during extremely cold weather, a lack \nof hot water, a blocked sewer line, etc.).  \n103 Remember, communication can prevent little problems from becoming big ones.  \nAttempting to work out problems benefits everybody. Sometimes, it is helpful to involve \nsomeone else, such as a trained mediator ( see page 106),  but it is not required. If the \nproblem truly cannot be resolved by discussion, negotiation, or acceptable compromise, then each party can look to the remedies provided by law.  \nGETTING HELP FROM A THIRD PARTY  \nMany resources are available to help tenants and landlords resolve problems and \nthere are some limited resources to help tenants with access to rental assistance programs.

Legal aid organizations \nmay provide eviction defense services, including legal advice, information and \nrepresentation, to low -income tenants. Some law schools offer free advice and \nassistance through landlord- tenant clinics . See page 105 for your local services.  \nTenants should be cautious about using for -profit so -called eviction defense clinics or \nbankruptcy clinics that are not tied to attorneys or a local non- profit organization. While \nthere are many free and low -cost services available through your local Court  and non - \nprofit organizations, there are certain businesses that hold themselves out to be clinics \n104 that are not legitimate or may be legitimate but costly. Exercise caution when any clinic \nuses high- pressure sales tactics, make false promises such as guaranteeing a favorable \noutcome, obtains your signature on blank forms, take upfront fees, and do not communicate with you about your case at all.  \nThese clinics may promise to get a federal stay (also called an automatic stay) of an \neviction action. This usually means that the clinic intends to file a bankruptcy petition for the tenant (see the discussion of filing bankruptcy on page 101). While  this may stop the \neviction temporarily, it can have extremely negative effects on the tenant\u2019s future ability to rent property or to obtain credit as the bankruptcy will be part of the tenant\u2019s credit record for as long as 10 years . Always do your research and  consult an eviction defense \nattorney before filing any such petition, especially if a clinic is doing it solely for the purpose of delaying an eviction.  \nTenants should distinguish between those who are licensed and in good standing to \npractice law in California versus someone who is a registered Unlawful Detainer Assistant or Legal Document Assistant. The latter can help with the completion of court forms but cannot give legal advice. Be sure to check that someone who claims to be an \nattorney is actually licensed to practice law in California. An attorney\u2019s license status can be checked at http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/LicenseeSearch/QuickSearch . \nUnlawful detainer assistants (UDAs) are non -lawyers who are in business to provide \nadvice and assistance to landlords and tenants on unlawful detainer issues. UDAs must \nbe registered with the County Clerk\u2019s office in the counties where they have their \nprincipal place of business and where they do business.460 A tenant who signs a contract  \nwith a UDA can cancel the contract within 24 hours after signing it.461\nLegal document assistants (LDAs) are non- lawyers who type and file legal documents \nas directed by people who are representing themselves in legal matters. Similar \nregistration and contract cancellation requirements apply to legal document \nassistants.462\nThe fact that a UDA or an LDA is properly registered with the County Clerk does not \nguarantee that the UDA or LDA has the knowledge or ability to help you. Anytime you \nare dealing with someone who holds themselves out as an LDA or UDA, be sure to ask for their registration information. UDAs are required to disclose their registration \ninformation on any legal pleadings they file with the Court.  \nLandlord and Tenants should also be cautious about using so- called Paralegal \nServices that offer to file documents with the Courts and representation in Court \nproceedings. Paralegals are non -lawyers who cannot engage in the practice of law, \ncannot appear in Court, and must be supervised and affiliated with a licensed attorney in order to provide any sort of legal assistance or advice.\n463 Unlike UDAs or LDAs, there is \nno required licensing or registration for paralegals. Many of these services will charge upfront fees and will do nothing, often to the detriment of the person they claim  to be \nrepresenting.  \nARBITRATION AND MEDIATION  \nSome local housing agencies refer landlord- tenant disputes to local dispute resolution \ncenters or mediation services. The goal of these services is to resolve disputes without \nthe burden, stress, and expense of going to court. Courts in California collect fees that \nare used to operate Alternative Dispute Resolution programs that are overseen by \n105 county go vernments. Th ese mediation programs  are typically ava ilable t o parties to \ncer\ntain court ac tions,  are  free of ch arge, and ca n be accessed bef or e a trial or eve n at  \nthe courthouse on t he da y of trial. \nMedi\nation involves a ssistance from an impartial t hi rd person, called a mediator , who \nhel\nps the t enant and l andlord reach  a voluntary a greement on how to settle the di sput e. \nThe mediator doe s not  make a binding decision in t he ca se, bu t  instead facilitates t he \npar\nties a chieving their o wn agreement. Willingness  to  participate in m edi ation is e ntirely \nup t\no the di scr etion of an y of  the par ties. \nA\nrbitration involves referral of the disput e to an i mpartial t hi rd person, ca lled an \narbitrator , who decides the case. If t he landlord and tenant ag ree to submit their di spute \nt\no arbitration, they w ill be bound by t he decision of t he ar bitrator, unl ess they agr ee to \nnonbi\nnding arbitration. U nlike mediation, w hi ch is usually ava ilable at no or l ittle cost, \narbi\ntration often r equires payment of significant f ees t o  a professional ar bitrator. The cost \nfor ar bitration is usu al ly split equal ly by the parties, but a t enant could ask  the landl ord to \nbear a\n greater sh are of t he cost, i ncludi ng the entire cost. I t is  a legally un settled \nquestion as t o whet her a t erm of a rental agr eem ent that r equires a t enant t o  submit \ndisp\nutes to arbitration is i n fact en forceable. \nTenants\n and l andlords should consider resolving their di sputes by mediation or \nar\nbitration instead of a lawsuit, i f it is ava ilable to t hem  and they have  the financial \nm\neans to participate i n these programs.  Mediat ion is al most al ways  fas ter, ch eaper, and \nless str\nessful t han goi ng to court. While arbitration i s mor e f ormal t han mediation, \narbi\ntration can be faster, and is usu all y less stressful and burdensome, t ha n a court \naction. It i s im portant f or both parties to r emember that a mediator/arbitrator i s  supposed \nto \nremain neutral and is not an at torney or advo cate for ei ther par ty, rather they a re \nch\narged with t rying to r each a resoluti on t hat i s agreeable to bot h par ties. Mediators and \nAr\nbitrators ar e also  not a lways  experts i n the area of l aw, so  it is impo rtant f or both \npart\nies to be i nformed of their rights and obligations pr ior  to ent ering into mediation or \narbi\ntration. \nMedi\nation services a re listed i n the co mmercial or adve rtising sections o f  the \ntelephone book under Mediation Services.

A high credit score (for example, 750 and up) indicates a history of better credit performance than other consumers, and potentially a better credit risk.

The landlord \nmay not know that these people (called \u201coccupants\u201d) are living in the rental unit, and \ntherefore may not name them as defendants in the summons and complaint. As a result, these occupants are not named in the writ of possession if the landlord wins the unlawful detainer action. A sheriff enforcing the writ of possession cannot lawfully  evict an \noccupant whose name does not appear on the writ of possession and who claims to have lived in the unit since before the unlawful detainer lawsuit was filed, if the occupant \ntakes the correct steps in time (see writ of possession, page 100). \nThe landlord can take steps to avoid this result. The landlord can instruct the marshal, \nsheriff or registered process server who serves the summons and complaint on the \nnamed defendants to ask whether there are other occupants living in the unit who have not been named as defendants. If there are, the person serving the summons and complaint can serve each of the so- called \u201cunnamed occupants\u201d with a blank \nPrejudgment Claim of Right to Possession form and an extra copy of the summons and  \ncomplaint.\n465 \nThese occupants then have 10 days from the date they are served to file a \nPrejudgment Claim of Right to Possession form with the Clerk of Court, and to pay the \nclerk the required filing fee (or file an Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs \nif they are unable to pay the filing fee [see page 93 ]). Any unnamed occupant who does \nnot file a Prejudgment Claim of Right to Possession form with the Clerk of Court (along with the filing fee or a request for waiver of the fee) can then be evicted if the tenants named in the eviction action lose at court. \nAn unnamed occupant who files a Prejudgment Claim of Right to Possession form \nautomatically becomes a defendant in the unlawful detainer lawsuit and must file an \nanswer to the complaint within five days after filing the form.\n466 If the landlord wins, the \noccupant will be subject to the eviction. Any other occupant who did not file a \nPrejudgment Claim cannot delay the eviction,  whether or not that occupant is named in \nthe writ of  possession issued by the court.467 \nOCCUPANTS NOT NAMED IN WRIT OF POSSESSION  \nThe landlord sometimes does not serve a Prejudgment Claim of Right to Possession \nform on the unnamed occupants when the unlawful detainer complaint is served. When \nthe sheriff arrives to enforce the writ of possession (that is, to evict the tenants [see wr it \nof possession, page 100 ]), an occupant whose name does not appear on the writ of \npossession, and who claims a right of possession, may fill out a Claim of Right to \nPossession form and give it to the sheriff. The sheriff must then stop the eviction of that \noccupant and must give the occupant a copy of the completed form or a receipt for  it.468 \nWithin two court days after completing the form and giving it to the sheriff, the \noccupant must deliver to the Clerk of Court the court\u2019s filing fee (or file an Application for \n115  Waiver of Court Fees and Costs if the occupant is unable to pay the filing fee (see page \n93)). The occupant also should deliver to the court an amount equal to 15 days\u2019 rent for the rental unit (the writ of possession must state the daily rental value of the rental  unit).  \nFive to 15 days after the occupant has paid the filing fee (or has filed a request for \nwaiver of the fee) and  has deposited an amount equal to 15 days\u2019 rent, the court will \nhold a hearing. If the occupant does not deposit the 15 days\u2019 rent, the court will hold the hearing within five days . \nAt the hearing, the court will decide whether or not the occupant has a valid claim to \npossession. If the court decides that the occupant\u2019s claim to possession is valid, the amount of rent deposited will be returned to the occupant. The court will then order further proceedings, as appropriate to the case (for example, the occupant may be given five days to answer the landlord\u2019s complaint and defend the eviction action).  \nIf the court finds that the occupant\u2019s claim to possession is not valid, an amount equal \nto the daily rent for each day the eviction was delayed will be subtracted from the rent \nthat is retur ned to the occupant, and the sheriff or marshal will continue with the \neviction.\n469 \n \n \nAPPENDIX 2 \u2014LIST OF CITIES WITH RENT CONTROL ORDINANCES (AS \nOF 2019)  \n \nAlameda \nBaldwin Park Berkeley Beverly Hills Burbank Camarillo Campbell  \nCity of Commerce  \nConcord Culver City East Palo Alto Emeryville Fremont Gardena Glendale Hayward \n116  Inglewood \nLos Angeles Los Gatos Menlo Park \nMountain View Oakland  \nPalm Springs Palo Alto Pasadena Redwood City Richmond Sacramento San Diego San Francisco San Jose  \nSan Leandro Santa Monica Thousand Oaks  \nUnincorporated Los Angeles County West  Hollywood  \nResources on rent control ordinances include The California Landlord\u2019s Law Book: \nRights & Responsibilities , 19th edition, (NOLO Press 2021) and California Practice \nGuide, Landlord- Tenant (Rutter Group 2021 ). \n117 APPENDIX 3 \u2014TENANT INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE RESOURCES  \nTenant Information and Assistance Resources listing is available through the \nDepartment of Real Estate\u2019s website at https://housing.ca.gov/ . \nThe website listing is updated periodically.
