If you need tailored guidance, consult a licensed California attorney.\n\nIt sounds incredibly stressful to face such a significant rent increase. In San Francisco, rent-controlled units are generally subject to the regulations set by the San Francisco Rent Ordinance, which typically limits annual rent increases to a percentage based on the Consumer Price Index. As of the most recent updates, this increase is usually around 1-2% per year, far less than the 20% your landlord is proposing.\n\nCould you please confirm the zip code of your rental unit so I can provide more precise information? Additionally, knowing when you received the notice of the rent increase would be helpful.",

    "content": "It sounds like you're dealing with multiple significant issues in your apartment. Given that your building is rent-controlled and was built in 1965, any rent increase should adhere to the guidelines set by the San Francisco Rent Ordinance. Increases over the allowable percentage, which is typically tied to the Consumer Price Index and generally around 1-2% annually, need to be justified by allowable pass-throughs or other legal exceptions.\n\nRegarding the ongoing plumbing issues, landlords are required under California Civil Code ยง1941.1 to maintain rental properties in a habitable condition, which includes working plumbing. If these issues have been persistent and unaddressed despite your notifications to the landlord, this could be a violation of your rights as a tenant.\n\n**EXTRACTED_FACTS:**\n```yaml\nclient_info:\n  Role: \"tenant\"\nrental_unit:\n  Location: \"94117\"\n  Unit_type: \"apartment\"\nissue:\n  Description: \"Landlord attempting a 20% rent increase and ongoing plumbing issues\"\n  Duration: \"ongoing for months\"\n  Category: \"rent increase, habitability\"\ntimeline:\n  Initial_occurrence: \"5 years ago for tenancy, recent months for plumbing issues\"\n```\n\nTo better assist you, could you tell me when exactly you received the notice of the rent increase? This will help determine if the notice was given in accordance with legal requirements.",

    "content": "It sounds quite challenging to deal with a sudden rent increase, especially when it's to cover costs that don't directly benefit your unit. In San Francisco, the Rent Ordinance typically restricts rent increases in rent-controlled units to an annual allowable percentage, which is usually around 1-2%. Increases above this rate, particularly for reasons like funding renovations in other units, are generally not permissible unless they fall under specific allowable pass-throughs, which usually do not include renovations of other units.\n\nSince your lease is expiring soon, it's also important to consider whether your landlord intends to offer you a new lease or move to a month-to-month agreement, which could affect your rights and options.\n\n**EXTRACTED_FACTS:**\n```yaml\ntimeline:\n  Rent_increase_notice_received: \"last week\"\nrental_unit:\n  Current_rent: \"$2500 per month\"\nissue:\n  Landlord_justification: \"cover renovation costs in other units\"\n  Lease_expiration: \"in 2 months\"\n```\n\nGiven the situation, it might be helpful to review the specific terms of your lease regarding rent increases and the renewal process. Could you upload a copy of your lease agreement? This would allow us to see if there are any specific clauses that might affect the legality of the rent increase.",
